question about learning programming in ece,"this might sound really stupid but im pretty clueless when it comes to like internships and that stuff;

im an ece/engr honors major but i have no coding experience (unless u count a little bit of scratch and java but its been two years since ive touched it so i dont even remember, i think my heavy math awards/ec's got me into ECE) but i plan to go into CS

so basically what happened: 

my family friend knows im an ece major and told me i should start looking at internships and said i should apply to their local company in houston for a full stack developer intern....butttttt i dont know how to code so

if i DO start looking for internships, will i be able to learn the programming i need to know for internships in ECE? or do i need to self-learn? and if so where should i start

sorry if i sound realllyyyy stupid",https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/ctnezv/question_about_learning_programming_in_ece/,,,,,,,,,1

ut dallas vs ut austin debate,"I  live in a suburb of Dallas and UTD is about 20 minutes from my house. If I were to go to UTD, I'd get a ton of scholarships and a stipend but would have the downside of knowing wayyy too many people there and never really leaving my hometown. There's also the fact that I wouldn't really be gaining too many new experiences because of how close the school is to things I already do and places I already visit, as well as never really leaving the friends and acquaintances I've already made. The only plus would be saving a ton on loans and tuition because UT would give me virtually zero scholarships. Is it worth it to go to UT or even out of state just to gain a new perspective in life and meet different people from places other than my hometown?

How is UT Austin's Math and CS PhD program?,"Hey guys I'm currently pursuing a BA in Math and CS at UC Berkeley as a sophomore, and I either want to pursue research in either Theoretical Computer Science or Applied Math. I have pretty good grades(3.8+), and I'm starting to do some research with a professor. I was wondering how difficult it is to get into these programs, as I heard UT is really strong in both of them. I was also wondering what your experience was like in these programs, and the benefits of coming here compared to another graduate school.

Does anybody have any insight into the AET program?,"Im a high school senior thats going to be applying this fall and i was conflicted on which major to apply to. I really like computer science, but Im also very interested in the creative aspect of things. I saw found the AET major just the other day and it looked really interesting. However i did notice that its very new and seems to have a bad reputation, but i was looking at posts from two years ago. 


Out of the paths there i was most interested in either the PLAI or Data visualization. I do something sort of similar now where i make light shows and sample music, so it was really cool to see that what Im doing now could actually be applied to a major. (Ok Im getting off topic)


Anyway, what Im asking is would it be worth it to go become a AET major? 

What kind of job opportunities present themselves after college? 

How much does the major do with getting your foot in the door(internships, etc.)?

Would it just be more worth it to play it safe and go CS?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/cvhcm6/does_anybody_have_any_insight_into_the_aet_program/,,1,,,,,,,
