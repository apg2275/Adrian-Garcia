The Trump administration on Friday issued a new rule that gives more power to the director of the agency that oversees the nation's immigration courts, a move that attorneys say will make it easier to reject immigrants' appeals to court decisions.
The change, part of a reorganization of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, is the latest in a series of minute policy changes that immigration advocates say are chipping away at routes through which a foreign national can seek refuge in the United States.
EOIR oversees the country's immigration court system, which is burdened by an 850,000-case backlog. The administration's new rule expands the EOIR director's power to accept or deny appeals to asylum cases, decisions that can set legal precedents that redefine asylum law.
EOIR Director James McHenry, a Trump administration appointee who spent much of his career as an attorney for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will have the authority - previously limited to the U.S. attorney general - to reverse decisions made by the Board of Immigration Appeals.
Last month, Attorney General William P. Barr reversed a decision that effectively set a new precedent preventing asylum seekers from gaining protection on the grounds that their relatives are being persecuted by criminals such as drug cartels in their countries.
Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year used the same authority to block the victims of gang violence and domestic violence from qualifying for asylum, though that move was later blocked by a federal judge. 
But the attorney general is limited in how frequently he can make calls on such cases, in part because of the breadth of his other responsibilities. By delegating that authority to the EOIR director, the new rule means the head of the office has been "granted a whole new power," said Astrid Lockwood, a D.C.-based immigration attorney at the Federal Practice Group who represents a number of Central American asylum seekers.
"In this administration, we've seen [the attorney general] use this authority a handful of times," Lockwood said. "The director can now use the simple excuse of a backlog, and decide any cases to clear that backlog . . . He can decide cases in ways more in line with the administration."
A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.
The rule is slated to go into effect on Monday when it is published in the Federal Register.
President Trump has made changing the U.S. immigration system - particularly by reducing the flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border - one of his top policy priorities. In addition to constructing a border wall, Trump has also sought to deter migrant families by removing certain legal protections for migrant children, separating migrant families at the border, and requiring a growing number of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated in U.S. courts. Earlier this summer, the president also struck a deal with Guatemala that would allow U.S. immigration authorities to deport some Central Americans to Guatemala to pursue asylum there instead. 
Nearly all of the efforts have been challenged by lawsuits.
Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security temporarily diverted most of its asylum officers in Boston and Newark to the border, virtually halting the processing of new asylum claims.
In a letter to area immigration attorneys, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services   wrote, "We intend to continue to interview a small number of cases in the Newark (Lyndhurst) office. In Boston, staff will continue to complete the process of interviewed cases, but no new interviews will be scheduled for the time being." 
The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates strict limits to legal immigration, last year described McHenry, who was appointed by Sessions, as "the point man for the effort to restore timely and efficient adjudication of immigration cases in the face of a tremendous case backlog."
"We're doing a top-to-bottom review inside the agency," McHenry said at the time, as the first in the group's "Immigration Newsmaker" speaker series. "We're looking for ways to be more efficient."

Six ways Trump's new 'public benefits' immigration policies could hurt children and schools; The administration recently announced it was going to change the criteria for extending green cards and visas to immigrants, to favor the wealthy.

Earlier this month the Trump administration announced that it was planning to change the way the United States decides who can receive visa extensions and permanent residency - known as green cards - based, essentially, on how wealthy the immigrant is.
             The Washington Post reported on Aug. 12:
             The new criteria for "Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds," due to  take effect Oct. 15, will set stricter standards for applicants seeking  legal permanent residency in the United States, criteria that will skew  the process in favor of the highly skilled, high-income immigrants  President Trump covets. Since its first days, the Trump administration  has been seeking ways to weed out immigrants the president sees as  undesirable, including those who might draw on taxpayer-funded benefits.          
             Wealth, education, age and English-language skills will take on greater importance in the process of obtaining a green card, which is the main hurdle in the path to full U.S. citizenship. U.S. immigration law has long-standing provisions to screen out foreigners who might be a burden on society, but the rule change amounts to an expansion of the government's definition of "public charge" - and who is deemed likely to become one.          
This post looks at how children and public schools could be harmed by this legislation. It comes from the National Education Policy Center (NEPC) at the University of Colorado at Boulder, which seeks to publish high-quality research on issues affecting education. It is directed by Kevin Welner, who is a professor at the school specializing in educational policy and law.
This is part of a newsletter sent out by NEPC, and I was given permission to publish it.
             Here's the piece in the newsletter:          
On August 12th, the Trump administration proposed a new rule to change the criteria considered when the U.S. government decides whether to extend visas or grant permanent residency ("green cards").
These criteria - which are inextricably tied to a history of bias in the immigration process - long included evidence about the likelihood of the immigrant becoming dependent on public benefits. But the approach that is now used focuses on cash benefits, such as Supplemental Social Security ("disability") or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ("welfare").
The proposed rule will expand that to the main non-cash benefits used by immigrants: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps; Medicaid; and housing vouchers and other housing subsidies.
The rule, if unchanged, will go into effect in 60 days barring judicial action (17 states plus DC have brought two lawsuits against the administration, alleging that the rule redefines the term "public charge" inconsistently with Congress' intent in the Immigration and Nationality Act; that it violates constitutional equal protection guarantees by effectively targeting immigrants from poorer areas in Asia, Latin America, and Africa; that it infringes on states' rights to protect their own residents; and that it punitively, arbitrarily and capriciously targets immigrants for using public benefits programs that are used by about half the country's residents).
School breakfast and lunch programs are not included for consideration in the proposal rule. But current policy automatically enrolls students in the federal free and reduced-price school meal program if their families receive food stamps - without having to fill out a separate application. Accordingly, if immigrant families avoid SNAP, they are less likely to receive the meals. Moreover, earlier this summer the administration proposed eliminating this automatic enrollment process. Thursday,
How might these changes impact children from immigrant families who need food stamps and other assistance? Research from the National Education Policy Center suggests that the consequences could be dire:
             1. Immigrant children from low-income families could lose services they need because their parents are afraid that the benefits could damage their chances to remain in the country: Even before these most recent policy changes were announced, immigrants, documented and undocumented alike, were on high alert as immigration enforcement was shifted from people with criminal records to anyone and everyone who was undocumented - with even U.S. citizens caught up in the raids.
             In a 2018 report co-authored by Jongyeon Ee, NEPC Fellow Patricia Gánda-ra of UCLA describes a teacher survey about the impact of such policies on schools. Educators reported that immigrant parents, fearing deportation, were afraid to sign any forms, including those that qualified their children for core services such as free or reduced-price meals. Such fears, even when technically inaccurate (as in the case of a family living in the U.S. on unexpired visas), are reasonable in the current context, and the new policies will almost certainly add fuel to the fire. For example, although school meal programs are not included for consideration in the proposal rule, we can expect that fearful families will nonetheless decline this public benefit. In short, immigrant parents must make tough choices between getting their children the nutrition, healthcare, and housing they need, and fears that they are reducing the odds that their families will be permitted to remain in the country.
             2. Schools that serve low-income students could lose funding: The percentage of students who qualify for free and reduced-price meals is a critical - if flawed - means of assessing the poverty rate of each school. If children are no longer automatically enrolled in the program, 275,000 students could lose eligibility for the program. Not only might this impact the children themselves, it could affect the funding their schools receive. That's because everything from state funding formulas to federal programs use free and reduced-price meal eligibility to distribute funds earmarked for students from low-income families. Even if the schools lose that funding, they will likely continue to serve the same low-income students - they will just have less funding available to serve them.
             3. The loss of nutrition and health benefits can literally kill a child - or at least reduce her odds of living a healthy life: When legal immigrants lost access to food stamps in the years after 1990s "welfare reform," babies' birth weights declined, parents reported that they were less healthy as children and adolescents, school absence rates increased, and kids experienced more doctor visits and hospitalizations, NEPC Fellow Diana Whitmore Schanzenbach of Northwestern University says in a 2018 paper she co-wrote. In a 2016 study, Schanzenbach and her co-authors found that childhood access to food stamps is associated with a reduced likelihood of "metabolic syndrome," which combines measures of obesity, body mass index, and the presence of chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Schanzenbach also describes research that finds that access to Medicaid reduces infant and childhood mortality and even extends into the next generation - with childhood Medicaid recipients themselves giving birth to healthier babies.
             4. The loss of nutrition and health benefits leads to poorer educational outcomes: Schanzenbach also summarizes research that finds that children who spend more time on Medicaid are more likely to graduate from high school, complete college, and score higher on exams in grades eight and four. Similarly, food stamp recipients are more likely to graduate from high school.
             5. If parents hesitate to sign up for health and nutrition benefits offered through schools, their children may miss out on the benefits of the very educational model with the best chance of helping them succeed in life: Community schools are a research-based model that offers enriched academic opportunities such as extended learning time and active family and community engagement. A core component of this model is that the school provides so-called "wraparound services" such as health, meals, and housing assistance. Well-implemented community schools demonstrate great promise at improving student outcomes, especially for historically lower-achieving student groups such as English learners and children from low-income families. If parents are coerced to prevent their children from participating fully in this model, their offspring may be missing out on key educational opportunities.
6. Housing and health care are foundational to learning: Children facing housing insecurity and unmet medical needs come to class having to overcome daunting challenges. As NEPC Fellow David Berliner has explained, when we deny children these and other basic necessities we deny them opportunities to learn - a reality also examined throughout the book "Closing the Opportunity Gap," edited by NEPC Fellows Prudence Carter and Kevin Welner.

Stephen Miller is right about immigration - but not in the way that he means

In a Post profile over the weekend, White House senior policy adviser and de facto immigration czar Stephen Miller explained why he cares so much about immigration policy:
             "Immigration is an issue that affects all others," Miller said, speaking in structured paragraphs. "Immigration affects our health-care system. Immigration affects our education system. Immigration affects our public safety, it affects our national security, it affects our economy and our financial system. It touches upon everything, but the goal is to create an immigration system that enhances the vibrancy, the unity, the togetherness and the strength of our society."          
Miller is right: Immigration does touch all those realms. Though perhaps not in quite the way he suggests.
For instance, immigration affects our health-care system in many ways - including by supplying it with talent.
In fact immigrants are overrepresented in the health industry. About 16.6 percent of the health industry is foreign-born, 13.7 percent of the U.S. population overall. A whopping 29.1 percent of physicians are foreign-born, according to a recent analysis of Census Bureau data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Immigrants also are overrepresented among dentists (23.7 percent); pharmacists (20.3 percent); registered nurses (16 percent); and nursing, psychiatric and home health aides (23.1 percent).
Immigration also plays an important role in our education system. International students, who generally pay full freight, have helped keep public universities afloat even as state legislatures have slashed their budgets. Their tuition dollars help schools cross-subsidize in-state students. Immigrants also have populated the STEM study programs that Americans show little interest in, especially at the graduate level - where many of those same immigrant students help educate American undergrads.
Here's the share of students in a selection of STEM graduate programs who are in the United States on temporary visas, according to the National Science Foundation's Science & Engineering Indicators 2018 report. Note that this measure likely understates the fraction of students who are foreign-born, as it does not include those who are permanent residents or naturalized citizens.
As for the relationship between immigration and public safety, the data suggest you might conclude that greater immigration leads to greater public safety.
At least, a study of immigration and crime trends across 200 metropolitan areas over four decades found that "immigration is consistently linked to decreases in violent (e.g., murder) and property (e.g., burglary) crime throughout the time period."  Other studies have found a similar relationship between the two trends. We don't know that the link is actually causal, of course, but we do have evidence              that undocumented immigrants commit (non-immigration-related) crimes at lower rates than do native-born Americans.
With respect to national security, Miller might do well to remember that immigrants serve in our military. As of 2018, there were 527,000 foreign-born veterans, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis of Census Bureau data. About 1.9 million veterans are the U.S.-born children of immigrants.
Some of those noncitizen military members with in-demand skills were expecting that their service would expedite their naturalization process, under a program launched in 2008 called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest. However, changes in recent years, under first the Obama administration and then under Trump, have effectively frozen that program.
What about our economy?
There's a lot to be said about how immigrants contribute to the economy, including through high rates of entrepreneurship. For example, immigrants have started more than half of the United States' start-up companies valued at $1 billion or more, according to a National Foundation for American Policy study. They start lots of smaller companies, too, at much higher rates than native-born Americans, according to data from the Kauffman Foundation.
Without immigration, the U.S. working-age population would be falling, which would weigh on economic growth. (Just look at Japan's struggles). And as I've written elsewhere:
             There's reason to believe that new immigrants may depress wages for earlier waves of immigrants who have similar skill sets. However, recent studies suggest that immigration (both authorized and unauthorized) actually boosts labor force participation rates, productivity and wages and reduces unemployment rates for native-born American workers, whose skills these immigrants tend to complement.          
             But don't these people drain the public coffers?          
             Immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, pay taxes - taxes that fund government benefits that in many cases they are not legally eligible to collect.          
             A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that the net fiscal impact of first-generation immigrants, compared to otherwise similar natives, is positive at the federal level and negative at the state and local levels. That's due mostly to the costs of educating their children. When their children grow up, though, they are "among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population, contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native-born population." In other words, by the second generation, immigrants are net-positive for government budgets at all levels.          
             What about the most destitute immigrants who come here, though? Surely they're sucking the government dry!          
             Nope.          
             An internal government report commissioned by Trump found that refugees brought in $63 billion more in tax revenue over the past decade than they cost the government. Finding those results inconvenient, the administration suppressed them, though they were ultimately leaked to the New York Times last year.          
So by all means, Miller, please remind the public that immigration has consequences for the broad policy landscape. But remembering the directionality of those consequences seems pretty important, too.

Trump picked a fight over Greenland with an unlikely target: Denmark's anti-immigration prime minister; Frederiksen called Trump a xenophobic populist in 2016. But she is more of a populist than she would like to admit, said one political scientist.

The preparations for President Trump's visit were underway. Denmark's national security agency was already working overtime. And the U.S. ambassador to Denmark even spotted a pair of red billboards atop a building with Trump's name in all-caps. "Denmark is ready for the POTUS @realDonaldTrump visit!" Carla Sands wrote Monday.
But by Tuesday night, all the work that went into welcoming Trump for the early September visit evaporated into nothing. As the Danes slept, Trump tweeted that the meeting was postponed   because Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she didn't want to sell Greenland.           
"Based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks to another time," he wrote. Days earlier, Frederiksen had called the idea "absurd."          
In snubbing Frederiksen, Trump has picked an unlikely fight with a world leader with whom he otherwise has plenty in common. Sworn in as Denmark's prime minister in June, Frederiksen ran her election campaign on an anti-immigration platform.
Frederiksen, the face of the left-leaning Social Democrat party, became the youngest prime minister in Denmark's history at the age of 41, and only the country's second female leader, after wooing voters from the far right by supporting tough restrictions on immigrants. Her political platform would be an anomaly in the United States: an anti-immigration leftist embracing a host of social welfare programs and labor union rights while supporting restrictions on the rights of asylum seekers and Muslims.
Were the two leaders to meet, Frederiksen and Trump would have plenty of reasons to disagree: climate change, trade agreements, etc. But when it comes to immigration - arguably Trump's single biggest issue - they have more in common than perhaps even Frederiksen may acknowledge, experts said.
"There's little difference between the present government and Trumpism on this count," Ulf Hedetoft, director of the Center for the Study of Nationalism and a professor at the University of Copenhagen, said in an email. "In fact they are both national populists, though the Danish party/Frederiksen would hate to admit it."
Frederiksen entered politics in the Danish parliament in 2001 at age 24, having grown up as a fourth-generation Social Democrat and the daughter of a typographer and teacher - the antithesis of Trump's social background, said Flemming Juul Christiansen, a public policy professor at Roskilde University. She would spend her career championing social welfare and trade unions as the minister of employment and justice, while ultimately shifting further to the right on immigration.
While campaigning for prime minister, she promised to broadly support the populist Danish People's Party's hard-line anti-immigration laws passed under her predecessor's administration, and followed through on that promise shortly after taking office. In an 18-page agreement, she kept in place a ban on Muslim women wearing burqas, and a measure forcing certain "ghetto children" - those who live in designated "ghettos" where half the population are "non-Western" immigrants   to undergo lessons in "Danish values." She also reinforced her support for repatriating refugees rather than integrating them, returning them to their home countries once it was safe.
"When you are a refugee and come to Denmark, you can be granted our protection," she said, according to the Local. "But when there's peace, you must go home."
The Social Democrats, under Frederiksen's leadership, have supported expelling asylum seekers to North Africa while their applications are processed. They have proposed a cap on "non-Western" immigrants, and have voted with the Danish People's Party to confiscate refugees' jewelry, money and valuables upon their arrival into the country, a move that critics say echoes Nazi Germany. Frederiksen has supported all of this, the Guardian reported.           
In one concession, however, in the 18-page agreement, Frederiksen abandoned a plan to house rejected asylum seekers awaiting deportation on an uninhabited island used for researching contagious animal diseases. She also agreed to begin accepting U.N. refugees again; her predecessor did not, the Local reported.          
Christiansen said that although Frederiksen and Trump align in favor of restrictive immigration policies, there's a key difference between the two. "She is not one who wants to implement more symbolic policies. She would not be one to want to build a wall," he said. "She would not come up with symbolic gestures."
Frederiksen, in fact, has specifically criticized Trump's vision for the wall, among other things. After Trump won the Republican nomination in 2016, she said in a lengthy Facebook post that she found his ideas about building a wall to be "hateful," saying a bridge would be better. "Donald Trump is both xenophobic and populist," she wrote.
In a 2017 Q&A with the Danish newspaper Politiken, Frederiksen said she was "deeply" worried about Trump's renouncement of international agreements. She called Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement a "serious setback." She said she found it "peculiar" Trump was questioning the role of NATO. And she wished Trump would focus on "restoring confidence" in the United States as leader of the free world - as opposed to sending out unpredictable "weird tweets."
Perhaps not so unlike the one Tuesday night.
Christiansen said the Danish political establishment is in shock over Trump's canceled visit.
"This is an embarrassment," he said. "Basically we have invited Trump, and he doesn't show up because we won't sell Greenland. I don't think anyone would imagine we would sell Greenland. You just don't sell autonomous people anymore."
Frederiksen has yet to respond to Trump's late-night tweet as of early Tuesday.
The Danish Royal House told CNN that Trump's postponement of the meeting was "a complete surprise," while Danish politicians told The Post it was insulting.
"This has never happened before," Danish Royal House Director of Communications Lene Balleby told CNN.
"This makes the concept of an elephant in a glass shop lose all significance," one politician told Politiken.

Deterrence isn't a solution to immigration issues

Regarding the Aug. 18 front-page article "The adviser who scripts Trump's border policy": 
While the buck stops with White House senior adviser Stephen Miller's boss, we can and should poke holes in Mr. Miller's arguments where they have so badly served the president and the nation. 
First, Mr. Miller uses deterrence as the rationale for inhumane treatment of asylum seekers and asserts that publicizing it "is not a bad strategy." The result - a "PR nightmare" from both family separations and "squalid and inhumane detention conditions at the border." The world's worst leaders rationalize the deterrent effect of their inhumane government practices. Their barbarism far exceeds the deterrence measures in which Mr. Miller takes comfort. But the United States' global influence suffers disproportionately when we drop our standards. 
No level of deterrence stops the overwhelming compulsion to flee the corrupt, gang-driven hell of the Northern Triangle. Without engaging root causes, we just keep nursing the problem. 
The omnipresent, anti-humanitarian Miller ecosystem must have resonated with the Office of Management and Budget, which in effect eviscerated the United States' legendary international humanitarian leadership in the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration by shifting its authorities and most of its funding to the U.S. Agency for International Development in the proposed 2020 budget. American exceptionalism is again at stake. It's up to Congress now to save it from extinction.

BEIJING - The British government said Tuesday that it is "extremely concerned" by the disappearance of an employee with its Hong Kong consulate who reportedly was detained while returning from a trip to mainland China, in a case that threatens to further strain relations between Beijing and the West.
Simon Cheng, a 28-year-old trade and investment officer at the consulate, planned to attend a technology conference in the border city of Shenzhen on Aug. 8 and return to Hong Kong the same day by high-speed train, his girlfriend told Hong Kong news website HK01.com.            
Cheng fell out of contact as he tried to pass through Chinese immigration that evening and has since been detained in the mainland for unknown reasons, she said, citing information she received from Hong Kong immigration officials. A friend of Cheng's who is in touch with his family confirmed to The Washington Post that Cheng has not been home since that date. 
The disappearance adds another irritant to the tense relationship between China and the West, which has deteriorated because of numerous disputes, not least the increasingly bitter trade spat with the United States. 
Beijing has accused Washington and London of fomenting protests that have convulsed Hong Kong over the summer. Canada has criticized China for holding two of its citizens, including a former diplomat, as political hostages in retaliation for the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, an executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei who is wanted in the United States on charges related to alleged violations of sanctions on Iran. 
There is no indication that Cheng, a Hong Kong permanent resident, was traveling under a British diplomatic passport when he vanished. His public social media profiles show that he began working at the consulate in December 2017 after receiving a master's degree from the London School of Economics.
"We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen," a British Foreign Office representative said in a statement Tuesday. "We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong."
Hong Kong's Immigration Department said it was assisting Cheng's family and had been in touch with mainland-based Hong Kong officials about the case.
Meanwhile, at a regular briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang denied knowledge of the incident.
Tommy Cheung, a former student leader and a friend of Cheng's, said he is aware of other Hong Kong residents detained in recent weeks in the mainland. 
Cheng wrote "Passing through" and "pray for me" in a phone text to his girlfriend as he approached Chinese immigration at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station in Hong Kong, according to HK01, citing images provided by his girlfriend. Under an arrangement between Hong Kong and mainland authorities, cross-border travelers pass through immigration inside the West Kowloon terminus. 
Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat who heads the Lau China Institute at King's College London, said Cheng appeared to be a local hire who was not covered under certain diplomatic protocols and was, therefore, more vulnerable than diplomats posted overseas.
"Far too frequently those who work in this situation are regarded by the Chinese as having divided loyalties. They are the ones who have pressure put on them, as pawns in a game," Brown said.
China could be sending a message to London, he added, noting: "It's a soft way of not doing a more extreme thing of expelling diplomats."
Details of Cheng's disappearance emerged as political tensions continued to simmer in Hong Kong following another huge march over the weekend. 
A proposal to allow certain suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to face trial in the mainland's Communist Party-controlled courts triggered the weeks of demonstrations in the city, where many viewed the now-shelved plan as a ploy by local leaders, acting in concert with Beijing, to erode Hong Kong's autonomy and comparative freedoms. 
Hong Kong is governed under a "one country, two systems" arrangement within China, under which the territory is supposed to enjoy a high degree of autonomy for 50 years following its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Activists say there have been growing signs of Beijing's encroaching influence over Hong Kong, including tightening electoral restrictions, the expulsion of a foreign journalist, abduction of dissidents and the controversial opening of the train station where Cheng disappeared.
Arrangements at the station, which opened in September, allow for mainland police to operate and enforce mainland law within the terminus - the first time such measures have been permitted in Hong Kong. A report by the official Xinhua News Agency last year said that any traveler entering or leaving the station would be considered to be in the mainland and subject to Chinese law.
After the weekend protests, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pledged Tuesday to hold talks with people from across the political spectrum but did not appear to budge on demonstrators' key demands, including the full withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent investigation into police conduct during the protests.
For weeks, China's government has framed the protests as a "color revolution" instigated by the United States and Britain. China publicized the personal details and photo of an American diplomat based in Hong Kong this month, in an apparent effort to portray her as a hostile intelligence officer, drawing rebuke from the State Department.
Tensions have been particularly high at the border where a river separates Shenzhen from Hong Kong. 
In recent weeks, Chinese immigration authorities have demanded that travelers unlock their smartphones to show their message records and photo albums for inspection. Foreign journalists also have come under heightened scrutiny.
             Correction:              The Vienna Convention governs diplomatic relations between states. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the Geneva Conventions.

How Stephen Miller authors Trump's immigration policy; With unswerving loyalty, Miller has singular control of an issue central to the presidency

At President Trump's speeches and rallies, Stephen Miller often can be found backstage, watching the teleprompter operator. As other White House staffers chat or look at their phones, Miller's attention remains glued to the controls.
The energy and crowd-thrilling parts of Trump's speeches usually happen during his impromptu diversions from the planned address. When Trump veers, colleagues say, Miller sometimes directs the operator to scroll higher or lower through the speech, so when the president is ready to pick it up again, he will hit those passages and make those points.
Miller knows where he wants the president to go. 
At defining moments in his career, Trump has benefited from clever writers and brand-makers who helped craft his public image. A co-author made him a best-selling business guru with "The Art of the Deal." The producers of "The Apprentice" cast him as a reality television star.
Now it is Miller, Trump's 33-year-old senior adviser, who is writing the central plot of his presidency.
Two and a half years into Trump's term, Miller's power in the White House is at its peak, according to top administration officials. As one of Trump's longest-tenured and most trusted aides, his influence in the West Wing is rivaled only by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, they say.
Miller, a former press aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), was among the first staffers on Trump's presidential campaign. He has since provided Trump with unswerving loyalty and fierce devotion, translating the president's frustrations and grievances into exalted language and policy prescriptions.
In Trump, Miller has found a champion for his ideological goals. He is the singular force behind the Trump administration's immigration agenda - making him a crucial White House figure on an issue central to the president's reelection campaign.
In an interview Friday with The Washington Post, Miller aggressively minimized his role in the administration and would accept no credit for its direction. He said he sees himself as a conservative populist, someone who pushed his liberal high school in California to have the Pledge of Allegiance recited on a daily basis, who says he sees U.S. citizenship "as something sacred" and who regards immigration as a defining element of the nation's future.
Effusive in praising his boss, Miller said he experienced a "jolt of electricity to my soul" when he saw Trump announce his presidential run, "as though everything that I felt at the deepest levels of my heart were for now being expressed by a candidate for our nation's highest office before a watching world."
With sections of the West Wing under summer renovation, Miller has been working out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door, setting up in the Secretary of War suite, a spacious, elegant command post appointed with oil paintings, fine leather furniture and a small forest's worth of hardwood. 
Barely a decade removed from college, Miller is at the seat of power. His authority has grown in recent months as he engineered a leadership purge at the Department of Homeland Security, removing or reassigning the head of every immigration-related agency in a span of just seven weeks.
And his long-sought policy goals are reaching fruition. On Monday, Miller secured tighter immigration rules that can disqualify green-card applicants if they are poor or deemed likely to use public assistance, cutting off a pathway to U.S. citizenship for those immigrants who could become a burden on taxpayers, or "public charges."
Miller's horizon extends beyond one or even two presidential terms. He views the public charge rule as vital to his goal of reducing immigration, and he has told colleagues it will have "socially transformative effects" on American society. 
"Immigration is an issue that affects all others," Miller said, speaking in structured paragraphs. "Immigration affects our health-care system. Immigration affects our education system. Immigration affects our public safety, it affects our national security, it affects our economy and our financial system. It touches upon everything, but the goal is to create an immigration system that enhances the vibrancy, the unity, the togetherness and the strength of our society."
This account of Miller's role in the White House and his relationship to Trump is based on interviews with Miller and 22 current and former administration officials, nearly all of whom have worked directly with him. His colleagues speak of him with a mix of admiration, fear and derision, impressed by his single-minded determination and loyalty to the president, despite an awkward and sometimes off-putting style. Some of the same co-workers who deplore his political machinations say he can be charming and likable when he's not angling toward an outcome.
Miller often launches into pedantic arguments with others in the White House, citing lengthy, arcane statistics that he mentally stores like munitions. He reads "every economic analysis, every think tank paper, every Wall Street Journal editorial on immigration," said another colleague.
Obsessed with terminology, Miller tells others in the West Wing that how issues are talked about - and what terms the media and legislators use - is often as important or more important than anything else.
He is dismissive of Kushner's more moderate immigration views and efforts to forge compromise, other senior officials say, and Miller has questioned how much the president's son-in-law knows about the topic.
After the publication of this article online, Miller called those claims "utterly malicious fabrications."
"Jared and I are close friends, with deep mutual trust, and we work hand-in-hand together to support the President's agenda, including on immigration," he affirmed.
Several of the officials who shared their candid views were unusually concerned with how they would be quoted, worried that specific words or phrases could be traced back to them. They said Miller would read quotes about himself with forensic interest to identify his critics, and to retaliate.
Some officials have developed nicknames for Miller to avoid being overheard saying his name aloud. Staffers at one DHS agency call him "our little friend," or simply "SM."
While Miller's ardent views on immigration are well known, the nature of his relationship to the president is less fully understood. Miller has survived longer in the White House than nearly every other senior administration figure who is not a member of Trump's family. 
Although he frequently spoke at rallies during Trump's presidential campaign to warm up crowds, and later made numerous television appearances to defend administration policies, Miller has largely receded from public view in recent months. He has grown more influential even as his visibility fades.
Miller's restrictionist immigration agenda has lent a degree of intellectual and ideological coherence to the gut-level animus that fuels Trump, furnishing a policy framework for the president's "Make America Great Again" message.
The public charge rule is a case in point. "Does the president believe that poor immigrants who can't support themselves should live off the public dole? No," one senior official said. "Did he have any idea what the public charge rule was before Miller? No."
"You can't overstate how excited Stephen was for the public charge rule to be out there," said a senior administration official who, like some others who agreed to talk about Miller, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they fear angering him.
Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, said it was a "perfect example" of Miller's role in the administration.
"He's burrowed down into the apparatus to make fundamental change," Bannon said in an interview. "People don't even see a lot of the stuff he's working on."
As an argumentative young congressional staffer, and before that as a conservative student columnist at Duke University, Miller developed a reputation for showmanship and superciliousness, viewed by peers as a hunger for recognition. In the West Wing, he has learned to sublimate those impulses to advance his broader goals and make sure the credit goes to his boss. 
Colleagues describe him as a unique influence over the president, but some caution that his powerful reputation is overstated because Trump typically seeks input from multiple advisers. Miller does not have anything like a hold on the president, they say, but he works relentlessly to outmaneuver and wear down rivals to steer Trump where he wants to go.
Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, disputed this characterization. "Stephen works tirelessly on behalf of this country and the president, not to outmaneuver or wear down anyone," Grisham said in an interview.
Miller and the president have a relationship of "mutual trust," she said, calling Miller "very intellectual."
Miller rarely, if ever, disagrees with the president in meetings, and instead seeks to convince him behind-the-scenes, with afternoon meetings or visits to the residence or Oval Office.
Miller's allies in the immigration restrictionist movement - those who are seeking to curb the number of foreigners coming to the United States - say he has done more than anyone to advance their cause.
"I think he's changed the terms of the debate," said Steven Camarota, senior policy adviser at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that Miller aligned with as a congressional aide. "He's played a huge role in making the immigration debate less about the plight of illegal immigrants and more about what's in the best interests of the United States."
"He is intensely loyal and a good foot soldier," Camarota added. "And if you're president, you value that incredibly."
Miller said he took an interest in immigration in high school because it was a simmering topic in Southern California at the time. He was a contrarian in a family of Democrats. 
"All of my immediate, near immediate and distant relatives were all liberal Democrats," he said. "I don't think I ever met a conservative to whom I was related."
Miller said he challenged the teachers and administrators at his Santa Monica high school because he believed the history and government courses discouraged patriotism and failed to promote a shared American identity - the values he credits for successfully assimilating previous waves of immigrants, including his own family.
"I had the sense that the education system focused more on emphasizing the things that distinguish us rather than the things that unite us," Miller said. For immigration to function there has to be an emphasis on e pluribus unum, and creating a national cohesion."
Right-wing populism armed him to wage a culture war against what he viewed as an empty multiculturalism. The career he has built since then is one, long, breathless polemic.
Others who have left the administration say Miller should be judged as a failure even by the standards of his own immigration goals, noting that illegal border crossings have soared, many of Trump's initiatives have been blocked in court and the routine functions of the agencies responsible for U.S. immigration enforcement - including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol - have become politicized.
Among Miller's co-workers are a few who believe he harbors racist views. "I don't know what other principle could animate such a laserlike focus," said one former career official at DHS.
Miller bristled at the claim, calling anyone who labels him a racist "an ignorant fool, a liar and a reprobate who has no place in civilized society."
"It is a scurrilous and scandalous lie born of a complete and total lack of understanding of the harms done by uncontrolled migration to people of all backgrounds, and born of a contempt for this nation, for our law enforcement officers and for the citizens who live here - and oftentimes, I might add, born of a personal grudge against this administration," Miller said, without pause.
Those close to Miller say he views his work as "saving American society," that more "immigration control" can change the volume and profile of those coming to the United States.
Short of a legislative path to achieve that goal, he views changes to the public charge rule as the next-best option, with the potential to weed out hundreds of thousands of applicants per year.
The Republican Party, and especially its pro-business elements, have conventionally supported robust levels of legal immigration. Miller has been at the forefront of efforts to shred that consensus, which he views as "a broken establishment" and a "decayed system."
While many of Trump's advisers favored the president's rhetoric on the threat of illegal immigrants, they urged him to retain a more welcoming message for those seeking to come to the United States legally. But Miller insisted that slashing those visas should be central to the president's agenda, because it is central to the electoral map that runs through the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest.
Miller spoke of recently visiting Johnstown, Pa., for his grandfather's funeral, describing it as a once-vibrant community that collapsed after local steel mills shuttered. Miller slammed "globalism" and "the owners of capital" for moving jobs overseas in search of cheaper labor.
"When you see the idled steel mills and you think about and you look at the empty town squares and you think about how much was lost along with the steel mill in the sense that it's a whole community and a community memory that's gone," Miller said.
Miller drafts most of the president's public remarks, sometimes chatting with him beforehand to hear his thoughts and then crafting them into a speech. Trump often does not look at a speech until the plane ride before he gives it, current and former aides said, making Miller's tone more influential.
"The thing about Stephen is he can bully anybody he wants because he and the president share similar views, and he is channeling the president's beliefs," said a senior official.
Because Trump has strong feelings about immigration but just superficial knowledge of how the immigration system works, the president relies heavily on Miller to explain and interpret it for him, the official said.
"Miller speaks with 100 percent confidence in whatever he does, and with a tone of absolute authority," another former official said. 
Several senior figures said Miller has been determined to ensure he remains the dominant voice in the West Wing on immigration matters. In the presence of alpha male figures including former Chief of Staff and DHS Secretary John F. Kelly, or current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Miller tends to be more deferential, longtime observers say. 
Miller was determined to pass the hard-line Raise Act in 2017 - which sought to slash legal immigration levels in half - even though it was met with widespread opposition and skepticism in the West Wing, according to former senior administration officials. "He just methodically pounded away, got senators to say they'd support it and then found his way in front of the president," one former senior administration official said.
There was soon a public messaging push for the legislation that others opposed. Miller decided to go to the podium in the West Wing and defend it himself because efforts to convince and explain the policy to others on the White House communications staff did not go well.
Last summer, when Republicans still controlled Congress, Miller soured the president on the slightly more moderate immigration bill known as "Goodlatte II" that some administration officials regarded as the best shot at hammering out a deal with Democrats. Miller urged the president to demand more, including an end to the U.S. family-based immigration model, which the White House calls "chain migration." The efforts have failed so far.
"All of that stuff bogged down the effort and turned it into something no Democrat would ever vote for," another former official said. The administration has turned instead to executive actions. "Ever since then it's been a nonstop push to 'put points on the board' to show the president is fulfilling his immigration promises."
A senior Capitol Hill official who regularly interacted with the White House said most policy discussions were with Miller's policy office or  Kushner, in an effort to gauge what moderate Republicans would support, what Democrats might accept and whether a compromise was possible. 
During those meetings, Miller did not regularly push his colleagues on the Hill as he does DHS or other officials. "But the lingering question was always, 'Where is Stephen on this?' "
Most interactions, this person said, were Miller trying to scuttle a deal he did not like or interjecting himself at the last minute. Most everyone in immigration policy circles knew he had the most sway with Trump.
The legislative official said Miller was far less interested in cutting deals and more interested in brimstone rhetoric and keeping immigration as a fiery hot issue.
 "He is not looking to get something done in a bipartisan way," the person said. A number of GOP senators and aides - including Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) - have criticized Miller to Trump and have argued against Miller's effectiveness. 
Miller has pushed the president to embrace wedge issues, such as late-term abortion, a transgender military ban and immigration, seeing them as cultural wars the president can win.
One of his favorite tactics is to call "deep in the building" at DHS and other agencies, giving orders to employees several layers beneath the Cabinet secretaries. As DHS secretary, Kelly told Miller to stop doing that and instructed his own employees to alert him when Miller did. Kelly declined to be interviewed for this article.
But Miller continued under DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and began convening meetings on Fridays of lower-level employees, where he would alternately scream, demand and encourage, according to attendees. Cabinet heads would sometimes see their own staff leaving the West Wing and ask why they had been there. Nielsen would often find that her subordinates had talked to Miller about a policy without her being involved, current and former officials said. 
She and her staff instructed subordinates to alert the front office if Miller called them out of the blue to request statistics or discuss a policy proposal, insisting that the secretary's office would handle the response. They saw Miller attempting to marshal statistics to win arguments by blindsiding his rivals with their own agencies' data, making them look uninformed and incompetent when they appeared unfamiliar with the numbers he already had.
Last spring, with border crossings rising, Miller helped devise the "zero tolerance" prosecution effort with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions adviser Gene Hamilton. Homeland Security officials and Health and Human Services scrambled to come up with a plan to implement the crackdown. During a span of six weeks, border agents took children away from migrant parents and sent the adults to court for prosecution. At least 2,600 families were separated until public outrage forced the president to back down.
Miller defended the separations and had encouraged the president to enact them - telling others in the West Wing they would prove to be a migration deterrent. Trump soon realized it was a "PR nightmare," in the words of one senior administration official, and blamed Miller. The president also grew frustrated with Miller over the botched implementation of the travel ban in the first weeks of the administration.
Miller is among the few administration officials who continue to defend zero-tolerance separations today, insisting the approach would have worked if the policy had continued. 
Miller is obsessed, current and former administration officials said, with boosting deportations. Early in the tenure, he tried to persuade Kelly, as DHS chief, to deport anyone here illegally. Kelly wanted to focus on criminal felons, frustrating Miller, people familiar with the disagreement said.
"He is singularly focused on how to get people out of the country," a former senior administration official said.
At times when others have hesitated to implement Miller's directives, he has questioned their loyalty and encouraged the president to cut them loose. In April, when Ronald Vitiello was close to Senate confirmation as ICE director, the White House abruptly pulled his nomination, ending his 30-year career in federal law enforcement. 
Vitiello, along with Nielsen, had challenged plans to launch a "family operation" targeting thousands of migrant parents and children in long-planned raids - a move that was likely to inflame Democrats ahead of the confirmation vote. Asked why Vitiello was ousted, Trump told reporters he wanted to go in "a tougher direction." 
While some in the administration fret over images of squalid and inhumane detention conditions at the border, Miller has argued that they, too, are a deterrent - and that publicizing them is not a bad strategy.
One longtime Trump adviser said Miller is frequently focused on how many people are coming over the border. "He would say, look at these statistics, you're going to have a new city the size of Brooklyn or the Bronx every year? How long can the country sustain that?"
Senior officials at DHS say they sometimes feel torn between two bosses: the one who is close to the president and the other who actually runs their agency.
Miller has installed handpicked political appointees across DHS, including several who were staffers at restrictionist groups such as the Federation for Immigration Reform (FAIR). He will surprise lower-level staffers with phone calls urging them to implement his ideas, telling them "this is the most important thing you will do at your agency."
Miller rarely puts anything in writing, eschewing email in favor of phone calls. Written communications sent by others who closely ally with him are often viewed as the expression of Miller's wishes.
"He's always micromanaging everything we do, or trying to, without really knowing or appreciating the operational challenges," said a DHS official who has been on the receiving end of Miller's ire.
Miller was so eager for the administration to finalize the public charge rule this spring that he accused former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director L. Francis Cissna of moving too slowly, firing him in May and installing former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II in his place. Miller has told others he prefers political appointees who are not career agency officials, because he thinks the latter lack urgency and are too accustomed to what he calls "bureaucratic inertia."
One senior official who works with Miller said he's rightly skeptical of the traditional policymaking process, because he expects every administration initiative on immigration to be blocked in federal court.
"Stephen's argument, in a nutshell, is that you can go through the whole process, dot every i, cross every t, get thousands of comments, come up with the regulation - and we'll still get sued and an activist judge will enjoin it," a senior official said.
"His argument is that judges are not making decisions based on facts, so there's no point to trying to win a political fight with a legal fight," the official said. "Just do the reg and try to get to the Supreme Court as fast as possible." 
Some grass-roots activists whom Miller cultivated during Trump's campaign also have soured on him, including Sara Blackwell, the founder of a group called Protect American Workers.
Blackwell, a Florida attorney, represented Disney employees in a lawsuit against the company; they sued claiming they were directed to train foreign workers hired to replace them. Seeing ideological kinship with her on the same economic arguments against outsourcing and guest worker programs, Miller invited Blackwell to campaign rallies in 2015, and she said she spoke at several events.
"Stephen Miller taught me a lot," she said. "I thought he was brilliant. He blew my mind with how much he knew."
After Trump's victory, Miller invited Blackwell to visit the White House, a visit she believed was meant to help convey the message that the president would deliver on his pledges to "protect American workers." Blackwell published an op-ed on the Breitbart news site after her White House visit saying as much. 
An aide to Miller called Blackwell soon after, chastising her for writing about the meeting without Miller's permission.
"He hasn't spoken to me since then," Blackwell said in an interview. She said she and others feel discarded by Miller and Trump.
Miller, who turns 34 in the coming week, said he has no plans beyond his current job and no personal ambitions. There is only Trump.
"Every day of my life I thank God for having the privilege to come and work here for this president and this mission," he said. "And you cannot understand me, you cannot understand anything that I say, do or think if you do not understand that my sole motivation is to serve this president and this country, and there is no other."
Miller finished speaking and ended the interview, apologizing. He was late for a meeting elsewhere in the building. He rushed out of his office and started down the hallway. He was running.

At President Trump's speeches and rallies, Stephen Miller often can be found backstage, watching the teleprompter operator. As other White House staffers chat or look at their phones, Miller's attention remains glued to the controls.
The energy and crowd-thrilling parts of Trump's speeches usually happen during his impromptu diversions from the planned address.

With sections of the West Wing under summer renovation, Miller has been working out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door, setting up in the Secretary of War suite, a spacious, elegant command post appointed with oil paintings, fine leather furniture and a small forest's worth of hardwood.

Miller often launches into pedantic arguments with others in the White House, citing lengthy, arcane statistics that he mentally stores like munitions. He reads "every economic analysis, every think tank paper, every Wall Street Journal editorial on immigration," said another colleague.
Obsessed with terminology, Miller tells others in the West Wing that how issues are talked about - and what terms the media and legislators use - is often as important or more important than anything else.
He is dismissive of Kushner's more moderate immigration views and efforts to forge compromise, other senior officials say, and Miller has questioned how much the president's son-in-law knows about the topic.
After the publication of this article online, Miller called those claims "utterly malicious fabrications."
"Jared and I are close friends, with deep mutual trust, and we work hand-in-hand together to support the president's agenda, including on immigration," he said.
 Several of the officials who shared their candid views were unusually concerned with how they would be quoted, worried that specific words or phrases could be traced back to them. They said Miller would read quotes about himself with forensic interest to identify his critics, and to retaliate.
Some officials have developed nicknames for Miller to avoid being overheard saying his name aloud. Staffers at one DHS agency call him "our little friend," or simply "SM."
While Miller's ardent views on immigration are well known, the nature of his relationship to the president is less fully understood. Miller has survived longer in the White House than nearly every other senior administration figure who is not a member of Trump's family. 
Although he frequently spoke at rallies during Trump's presidential campaign to warm up crowds, and later made numerous television appearances to defend administration policies, Miller has largely receded from public view in recent months. He has grown more influential even as his visibility fades.
Miller's restrictionist immigration agenda has lent a degree of intellectual and ideological coherence to the gut-level animus that fuels Trump, furnishing a policy framework for the president's "Make America Great Again" message.
The public charge rule is a case in point. "Does the president believe that poor immigrants who can't support themselves should live off the public dole? No," one senior official said. "Did he have any idea what the public charge rule was before Miller? No."
"You can't overstate how excited Stephen was for the public charge rule to be out there," said a senior administration official who, like some others who agreed to talk about Miller, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they fear angering him.
Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, said it was a "perfect example" of Miller's role in the administration.
"He's burrowed down into the apparatus to make fundamental change," Bannon said in an interview. "People don't even see a lot of the stuff he's working on."
As an argumentative young congressional staffer, and before that as a conservative student columnist at Duke University, Miller developed a reputation for showmanship and superciliousness, viewed by peers as a hunger for recognition. In the West Wing, he has learned to sublimate those impulses to advance his broader goals and make sure the credit goes to his boss. 
Colleagues describe him as a unique influence over the president, but some caution that his powerful reputation is overstated because Trump typically seeks input from multiple advisers. Miller does not have anything like a hold on the president, they say, but he works relentlessly to outmaneuver and wear down rivals to steer Trump where he wants to go.
Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, disputed this characterization. "Stephen works tirelessly on behalf of this country and the president, not to outmaneuver or wear down anyone," Grisham said in an interview.
Miller and the president have a relationship of "mutual trust," she said, calling Miller "very intellectual."
Miller rarely, if ever, disagrees with the president in meetings, and instead seeks to convince him behind-the-scenes, with afternoon meetings or visits to the residence or Oval Office.
Miller's allies in the immigration restrictionist movement - those who are seeking to curb the number of foreigners coming to the United States - say he has done more than anyone to advance their cause.
"I think he's changed the terms of the debate," said Steven Camarota, senior policy adviser at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that Miller aligned with as a congressional aide. "He's played a huge role in making the immigration debate less about the plight of illegal immigrants and more about what's in the best interests of the United States."
"He is intensely loyal and a good foot soldier," Camarota added. "And if you're president, you value that incredibly."
Miller said he took an interest in immigration in high school because it was a simmering topic in Southern California at the time. He was a contrarian in a family of Democrats. 
"All of my immediate, near immediate and distant relatives were all liberal Democrats," he said. "I don't think I ever met a conservative to whom I was related."
Miller said he challenged the teachers and administrators at his Santa Monica high school because he believed the history and government courses discouraged patriotism and failed to promote a shared American identity - the values he credits for successfully assimilating previous waves of immigrants, including his own family.
"I had the sense that the education system focused more on emphasizing the things that distinguish us rather than the things that unite us," Miller said. "For immigration to function there has to be an emphasis on e pluribus unum, and creating a national cohesion."
Right-wing populism armed him to wage a culture war against what he viewed as an empty multiculturalism. The career he has built since then is one, long, breathless polemic.
Others who have left the administration say Miller should be judged as a failure even by the standards of his own immigration goals, noting that illegal border crossings have soared, many of Trump's initiatives have been blocked in court and the routine functions of the agencies responsible for U.S. immigration enforcement - including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol - have become politicized.
Among Miller's co-workers are a few who believe he harbors racist views. "I don't know what other principle could animate such a laserlike focus," said one former career official at DHS.
Miller bristled at the claim, calling anyone who labels him a racist "an ignorant fool, a liar and a reprobate who has no place in civilized society."
"It is a scurrilous and scandalous lie born of a complete and total lack of understanding of the harms done by uncontrolled migration to people of all backgrounds, and born of a contempt for this nation, for our law enforcement officers and for the citizens who live here - and oftentimes, I might add, born of a personal grudge against this administration," Miller said, without pause.
Those close to Miller say he views his work as "saving American society," that more "immigration control" can change the volume and profile of those coming to the United States.
Short of a legislative path to achieve that goal, he views changes to the public charge rule as the next-best option, with the potential to weed out hundreds of thousands of applicants per year.
The Republican Party, and especially its pro-business elements, have conventionally supported robust levels of legal immigration. Miller has been at the forefront of efforts to shred that consensus, which he views as "a broken establishment" and a "decayed system."
While many of Trump's advisers favored the president's rhetoric on the threat of illegal immigrants, they urged him to retain a more welcoming message for those seeking to come to the United States legally. But Miller insisted that slashing those visas should be central to the president's agenda, because it is central to the electoral map that runs through the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest.
Miller spoke of recently visiting Johnstown, Pa., for his grandfather's funeral, describing it as a once-vibrant community that collapsed after local steel mills shuttered. Miller slammed "globalism" and "the owners of capital" for moving jobs overseas in search of cheaper labor.
"When you see the idled steel mills and you think about and you look at the empty town squares and you think about how much was lost along with the steel mill in the sense that it's a whole community and a community memory that's gone," Miller said.
Miller drafts most of the president's public remarks, sometimes chatting with him beforehand to hear his thoughts and then crafting them into a speech. Trump often does not look at a speech until the plane ride before he gives it, current and former aides said, making Miller's tone more influential.
"The thing about Stephen is he can bully anybody he wants because he and the president share similar views, and he is channeling the president's beliefs," said a senior official.
Because Trump has strong feelings about immigration but just superficial knowledge of how the immigration system works, the president relies heavily on Miller to explain and interpret it for him, the official said.
"Miller speaks with 100 percent confidence in whatever he does, and with a tone of absolute authority," another former official said. 
Several senior figures said Miller has been determined to ensure he remains the dominant voice in the West Wing on immigration matters. In the presence of alpha male figures including former Chief of Staff and DHS Secretary John F. Kelly, or current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Miller tends to be more deferential, longtime observers say. 
Miller was determined to pass the hard-line Raise Act in 2017 - which sought to slash legal immigration levels in half - even though it was met with widespread opposition and skepticism in the West Wing, according to former senior administration officials. "He just methodically pounded away, got senators to say they'd support it and then found his way in front of the president," one former senior administration official said.
There was soon a public messaging push for the legislation that others opposed. Miller decided to go to the podium in the West Wing and defend it himself because efforts to convince and explain the policy to others on the White House communications staff did not go well.
Last summer, when Republicans still controlled Congress, Miller soured the president on the slightly more moderate immigration bill known as "Goodlatte II" that some administration officials regarded as the best shot at hammering out a deal with Democrats. Miller urged the president to demand more, including an end to the U.S. family-based immigration model, which the White House calls "chain migration." The efforts have failed so far.
"All of that stuff bogged down the effort and turned it into something no Democrat would ever vote for," another former official said. The administration has turned instead to executive actions. "Ever since then it's been a nonstop push to 'put points on the board' to show the president is fulfilling his immigration promises."
A senior Capitol Hill official who regularly interacted with the White House said most policy discussions were with Miller's policy office or  Kushner, in an effort to gauge what moderate Republicans would support, what Democrats might accept and whether a compromise was possible. 
During those meetings, Miller did not regularly push his colleagues on the Hill as he does DHS or other officials. "But the lingering question was always, 'Where is Stephen on this?' "
Most interactions, this person said, were Miller trying to scuttle a deal he did not like or interjecting himself at the last minute. Most everyone in immigration policy circles knew he had the most sway with Trump.
The legislative official said Miller was far less interested in cutting deals and more interested in brimstone rhetoric and keeping immigration as a fiery hot issue.
 "He is not looking to get something done in a bipartisan way," the person said. A number of GOP senators and aides - including Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) - have criticized Miller to Trump and have argued against Miller's effectiveness. 
Miller has pushed the president to embrace wedge issues, such as late-term abortion, a transgender military ban and immigration, seeing them as cultural wars the president can win.
One of his favorite tactics is to call "deep in the building" at DHS and other agencies, giving orders to employees several layers beneath the Cabinet secretaries. As DHS secretary, Kelly told Miller to stop doing that and instructed his own employees to alert him when Miller did.  
But Miller continued under DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and began convening meetings on Fridays of lower-level employees, where he would alternately scream, demand and encourage, according to attendees. Cabinet heads would sometimes see their own staff leaving the West Wing and ask why they had been there. Nielsen would often find that her subordinates had talked to Miller about a policy without her being involved, current and former officials said. 
She and her staff instructed subordinates to alert the front office if Miller called them out of the blue to request statistics or discuss a policy proposal, insisting that the secretary's office would handle the response. They saw Miller attempting to marshal statistics to win arguments by blindsiding his rivals with their own agencies' data, making them look uninformed and incompetent when they appeared unfamiliar with the numbers he already had.
Last spring, with border crossings rising, Miller helped devise the "zero tolerance" prosecution effort with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions adviser Gene Hamilton. Homeland Security officials and Health and Human Services scrambled to come up with a plan to implement the crackdown. During a span of six weeks, border agents took children away from migrant parents and sent the adults to court for prosecution. At least 2,600 families were separated until public outrage forced the president to back down.
Miller defended the separations and had encouraged the president to enact them - telling others in the West Wing they would prove to be a migration deterrent. Trump soon realized it was a "PR nightmare," in the words of one senior administration official, and blamed Miller. The president also grew frustrated with Miller over the botched implementation of the travel ban in the first weeks of the administration.
Miller is among the few administration officials who continue to defend zero-tolerance separations today, insisting the approach would have worked if the policy had continued. 
Miller is obsessed, current and former administration officials said, with boosting deportations. Early in the tenure, he tried to persuade Kelly, as DHS chief, to deport anyone here illegally. Kelly wanted to focus on criminal felons, frustrating Miller, people familiar with the disagreement said.
"He is singularly focused on how to get people out of the country," a former senior administration official said.
At times when others have hesitated to implement Miller's directives, he has questioned their loyalty and encouraged the president to cut them loose. In April, when Ronald Vitiello was close to Senate confirmation as ICE director, the White House abruptly pulled his nomination, ending his 30-year career in federal law enforcement. 
Vitiello, along with Nielsen, had challenged plans to launch a "family operation" targeting thousands of migrant parents and children in long-planned raids - a move that was likely to inflame Democrats ahead of the confirmation vote. Asked why Vitiello was ousted, Trump told reporters he wanted to go in "a tougher direction." 
While some in the administration fret over images of squalid and inhumane detention conditions at the border, Miller has argued that they, too, are a deterrent - and that publicizing them is not a bad strategy.
One longtime Trump adviser said Miller is frequently focused on how many people are coming over the border. "He would say, look at these statistics, you're going to have a new city the size of Brooklyn or the Bronx every year? How long can the country sustain that?"
Senior officials at DHS say they sometimes feel torn between two bosses: the one who is close to the president and the other who actually runs their agency.
Miller has installed handpicked political appointees across DHS, including several who were staffers at restrictionist groups such as the Federation for Immigration Reform (FAIR). He will surprise lower-level staffers with phone calls urging them to implement his ideas, telling them "this is the most important thing you will do at your agency."
Miller rarely puts anything in writing, eschewing email in favor of phone calls. Written communications sent by others who closely ally with him are often viewed as the expression of Miller's wishes.
"He's always micromanaging everything we do, or trying to, without really knowing or appreciating the operational challenges," said a DHS official who has been on the receiving end of Miller's ire.
Miller was so eager for the administration to finalize the public charge rule this spring that he accused former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director L. Francis Cissna of moving too slowly, firing him in May and installing former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II in his place. Miller has told others he prefers political appointees who are not career agency officials, because he thinks the latter lack urgency and are too accustomed to what he calls "bureaucratic inertia."
One senior official who works with Miller said he's rightly skeptical of the traditional policymaking process, because he expects every administration initiative on immigration to be blocked in federal court.
"Stephen's argument, in a nutshell, is that you can go through the whole process, dot every i, cross every t, get thousands of comments, come up with the regulation - and we'll still get sued and an activist judge will enjoin it," a senior official said.
"His argument is that judges are not making decisions based on facts, so there's no point to trying to win a political fight with a legal fight," the official said. "Just do the reg and try to get to the Supreme Court as fast as possible." 
Some grass-roots activists whom Miller cultivated during Trump's campaign also have soured on him, including Sara Blackwell, the founder of a group called Protect American Workers.
Blackwell, a Florida attorney, represented Disney employees in a lawsuit against the company; they sued claiming they were directed to train foreign workers hired to replace them. Seeing ideological kinship with her on the same economic arguments against outsourcing and guest worker programs, Miller invited Blackwell to campaign rallies in 2015, and she said she spoke at several events.
"Stephen Miller taught me a lot," she said. "I thought he was brilliant. He blew my mind with how much he knew."
After Trump's victory, Miller invited Blackwell to visit the White House, a visit she believed was meant to help convey the message that the president would deliver on his pledges to "protect American workers." Blackwell published an op-ed on the Breitbart news site after her White House visit saying as much. 
An aide to Miller called Blackwell soon after, chastising her for writing about the meeting without Miller's permission.
"He hasn't spoken to me since then," Blackwell said in an interview. She said she and others feel discarded by Miller and Trump.
Miller, who turns 34 in the coming week, said he has no plans beyond his current job and no personal ambitions. There is only Trump.
"Every day of my life I thank God for having the privilege to come and work here for this president and this mission," he said. "And you cannot understand me, you cannot understand anything that I say, do or think if you do not understand that my sole motivation is to serve this president and this country, and there is no other."
Miller finished speaking and ended the interview, apologizing. He was late for a meeting elsewhere in the building. He rushed out of his office and started down the hallway. He was running.

'Who can stand on their own two feet': Ken Cuccinelli edits famous Statue of Liberty poem; The acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was defending the Trump administration's latest effort to restrict immigration.

Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said Tuesday that the poem etched on the Statue of Liberty welcoming immigrants to America should include a line qualifying that they be able to "stand on their own two feet." 
Cuccinelli made the comments while defending the Trump administration's announcement Monday that the government would consider an immigrant's use of social safety net programs, like Medicaid or food stamps, when deciding their permanent legal status. 
The famous words on the pedestal of the State of Liberty, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," were written by Emma Lazarus in 1883. In recent years, it's taken on new meaning as a rallying cry against President Trump's immigration policies. 
Cuccinelli, during an interview with NPR, argued it's the "American tradition" that immigrants welcomed into the country be those who are "self-sufficient, can pull themselves up from their bootstraps."
"Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?" NPR's Rachel Martin asked Cuccinelli.
"They certainly are: 'Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,' " Cuccinelli said. "That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge was passed - very interesting timing."
The public charge rule that Cuccinelli is referring to takes into account an immigrant's current or possible future reliance on the government when reviewing applications for permanent status. In its current form, officials take into account whether immigrants rely on the government for more than half of their income. 
Later Tuesday, in an interview on CNN, Cuccinelli was asked to clarify his remarks. He said he "wasn't writing poetry" and accused anchor Erin Burnett of "twisting this like everybody else on the left has done all day today."
"Wretched, poor refuse. Right?" Burnett said, referring to Lazarus's poem. "That's what the poem says America's supposed to stand for. So, what do you think America stands for?"
Cuccinelli responded by pointing to the historical context of the poem.
"Well, of course, that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies, where people were considered wretched if they weren't in the right class," he said, adding that the poem was penned one year after the first federal public charge rule was written.
The new Trump administration rule is "not an exclusionary, end-all, be-all," he said. "It's one factor."
Since the early days of the Trump administration, officials have been working on broadening that law to include an immigrant's use of other public benefit services, such as subsidies for health care, food and housing, as reason to reject an immigrant's application for a green card. 
On Monday, it made the regulation official, and it's set to go into effect Oct. 15.

ICE sweeps are cruel. Without immigration reform, they're pointless, too.; The United States cannot deport its way out of a dysfunctional immigration system.

THE DEPORTATION sweep Wednesday by hundreds of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at several food processing plants in Mississippi left a trail of tears, business jitters and widespread anxiety in places where undocumented immigrants are so tightly woven into communities that the towns would struggle to exist without them. The raids inflicted predictable suffering - especially among children whose parents were suddenly carted off - to such a degree that just 24 hours afterward, ICE had released some 300  of the 680 migrants it had arrested, including those who had no criminal records.
President Trump, whose own family business has for many years employed migrants who entered the country illegally , pronounced the Mississippi action a "very good deterrent " to unauthorized immigration. The evidence for that assertion is nil. Still, the sweep provided some useful reminders, not least that the United States cannot deport its way out of a dysfunctional immigration system.
First, the raids underline American agriculture's deep dependency on undocumented workers, who in 2014 accounted for 17 percent  of employees in the sector - and considerably more than that on farms and in many food processing plants. Little wonder that plant managers and local residents in towns targeted by ICE last week worried that the raids would sap their businesses and vitality.
The fact is that relatively few Americans want dirty, dangerous jobs that pay $12 per hour, while requiring some employees to report to work at 3 a.m. One study commissioned by the dairy industry suggested 3,500 dairy farms would close if half the country's foreign-born workers were deported; another survey, from North Carolina, showed that in 2011, a minuscule number of the state's nearly half-million  jobless workers applied for 6,500 available farm jobs, and most of those who were hired couldn't hack the work; most of the jobs were then filled by Mexicans.
Second, any large-scale enforcement action will inevitably result in families being broken apart - including those whose children are U.S. citizens. In 2017, two-thirds of unauthorized adult migrants had lived in the United States for more than a decade, according to the Pew Research Center; their median duration of residence was 15 years. Officials may not like the optics of crying toddlers and preteens whose parents have been taken away, but they shouldn't be surprised.
Third, businesses like the ones in Mississippi that employ undocumented workers are subject to federal prosecution. But it was Republican leaders in the House of Representatives last year, on Mr. Trump's watch, who blocked legislation that would have required private employers to use E-Verify, a data system used to check whether employees are legally present in the country. Farm groups, including those who represent major employers in Republican districts in California and elsewhere, are dead set against requiring E-Verify, knowing it would produce severe labor shortages.
ICE officials and federal prosecutors are right that deportation sweeps are within their purview as lawful enforcement actions. The problem is that the law is so blatantly misaligned with economic, social and political realities that it is magical thinking to believe that enforcement alone, in the absence of sweeping reform of existing laws, can make a dent in the nation's population of 10.5 million  undocumented immigrants.

People who support high levels of low-skilled immigration often claim that immigrants do work that native-born residents won't. The facts surrounding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids of seven Mississippi chicken processing plants show how untrue that claim is.
Documents released Thursday suggest that the operators of those plants knowingly hired undocumented immigrants for years in violation of federal law. They show that many of the workers wore ankle bracelets provided by ICE to monitor their location while others used multiple names and provided different Social Security numbers when applying to work at the same plant. If true, the only logical conclusion can be the operators wanted to hire people whose illegal status meant they wouldn't push for higher wages or make trouble.
Neither the companies that operate the plants nor any of their executives have yet been charged with violating immigration law, The Post reports. Peco Foods said it is cooperating with investigators, while Koch Foods denied knowingly employing people with false documentation to work. The other plants, PH Food, A&B and Pearl River Foods, did not respond or declined to comment to Post reporters.
Each of the plants have put out statements that they use the federal E-Verify system for all employees, though the newly released documents show that may not be the case at PH Food.
Such alleged flouting of the law is not a victimless crime. Each of the plants is located in cities or counties with high levels of poverty and extremely low incomes. There were plenty of workers available who probably would have loved to get jobs at the plants.
Jasper County, the location of one of the plants owned by Peco Foods, is a case in point. Jasper's unemployment rate this June was 7.4 percent, more than twice the national average. A majority-black county, Jasper County has a median household income of only about $35,000 and a 23.8 percent poverty rate. Those who live there need those jobs, but the employer's alleged scheme denied them that basic chance.
The other plant locations have similar demographics. Canton, Miss., is nearly 70 percent African American, with a 31.4 percent poverty rate for blacks. Scott County is 38 percent black, has a median household income of around $33,000 and a poverty rate more than 21 percent. Leake County is 42 percent black, has a median household income just under $36,000 and a poverty rate of nearly 22 percent. Pelahatchie, a town in Rankin County, is 40 percent black with a median income of just $35,000. Sense a pattern?
Given these figures, the economic impact of illegal immigration becomes clear. The Pew Research Center estimates that more than 7.5 million undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. labor force. Assuming their unemployment rate is roughly equal to the 3.7 percent national average, that means more than 7 million jobs are held by undocumented workers. That can't help but depress wages and opportunities for native-born American. As the Mississippi figures show, those victims of illegal immigration are often exactly the poor people of color whose continued poverty is a national tragedy.
This won't stop until immigration enforcement becomes a national and state priority. Mississippi law requires businesses to use E-Verify, the federal online system that checks the validity of Social Security numbers for job applicants, but that did not stop these employers from allegedly hiring hundreds of undocumented workers. Federal, state and local governments need to coordinate their systems and root out businesses employing these workers, or last week's ICE raids will continue to be a drop in a huge bucket.
There are lots of things the government can do to seriously enforce our immigration laws. National mandatory E-Verify is only the beginning, as the Mississippi example shows. Businesses should also be required to submit valid Social Security numbers for every employee, and the IRS should then audit large numbers of companies to check compliance. Companies should be denied tax deductions for employees found not to be validly in the United States, which would significantly increase those firms' federal and state tax bills.
We can also do a lot more to ensure native-born citizens get the first crack at these jobs. One of the raided plants opened in Leake County in 2017, but apparently there was no concerted effort to ensure these new jobs went to local residents. That's a government failure, as each county has a host of entities tasked with finding jobs for the unemployed, the disabled, mothers on welfare or prisoners reentering the community. These people are our fellow citizens - the ones most in need of the low-skilled, entry-level jobs that undocumented immigrants most often gravitate to. We should be more aggressive about seeking opportunities for these people and pressure local employers to look to these entities first when filling new openings.
The Trump administration has been serious about building the wall to keep illegal immigrants out of the country. The Mississippi ICE raids should be a wake-up call that spurs the administration to make employment enforcement every bit as much as priority as building the wall.

Federal immigration officials say they have probable cause that all five companies operating poultry plants raided by authorities in Mississippi last week violated immigration law by knowingly hiring undocumented immigrants, according to search warrant affidavits that cite videotaped statements of managers.
There were clear signs that the companies were hiring people who could not legally work in the country, the search warrants allege. Some workers wore ankle monitors as they awaited deportation hearings, gave Social Security numbers belonging to the deceased or were hired twice by the same manager even though the worker used different names on each occasion.
Since 2002, federal officials have reported more than 350 encounters or arrests of undocumented people who said they worked at two of the plants, Koch Foods and Peco Foods.
The companies for years have employed a stream of Guatemalan and Mexican immigrants who are not authorized to work in the United States, according to the search warrant affidavits, unsealed in federal court after Aug. 7 raids on seven plants operated by Koch Foods, Peco Foods, PH Food, A&B and Pearl River Foods. In the affidavits, Homeland Security Investigations agent Anthony Todd Williams Jr. said there is probable cause to believe that the chicken plants in Mississippi intentionally hired undocumented workers who presented fraudulent documents "for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain."
Williams wrote that individuals or companies shown to have "actual knowledge" of violating the employment law - meaning they knowingly hired at least 10 people not authorized to work for a year-long period - can be fined as much as $3,000 per undocumented worker. Employers can be imprisoned for as long as six months.
Neither the companies nor any executives have been charged with violating immigration law, although the documents name numerous managers who apparently knew about the widespread practice, according to the affidavits recently unsealed in Mississippi federal court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out the raids at seven chicken-processing plants operated by the companies, arresting 680 workers, about half of whom have been released to await further hearings.
ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said no charges have been filed against either workers or employers since the raids.
"No federal law enforcement agency is going to speculate as to if/when any federal criminal charges may be filed ... as that is the sole decision of the U.S. Attorney's office," he wrote in an email.
Mike Hurst, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, said in a statement that he could not comment on the case because the investigation is ongoing. "If you look at the history of this office, we have consistently prosecuted employers, companies and owners when evidence has been presented to us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they have violated federal criminal laws."
Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center, told The Washington Post that in his experience as a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer, such cases are time-consuming.
"Federal agents no doubt seized servers, hundreds of personnel files and thousands of additional documents to be analyzed and considered by agents and federal prosecutors," Johnson said. "The fact that no corporate officials were hauled out in handcuffs on the day of the raid is not the least bit surprising."
The records detail how ICE linked undocumented immigrants to the companies. Investigators found some employees via GPS coordinates at plants operated by all five companies. The employees previously had been arrested by Border Patrol agents in California, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona and released on electronic-monitoring programs, including ankle bracelets, to await court dates. In each case cited, the individuals listed addresses in small towns in central Mississippi where they could be located.
An undocumented Mexican woman working in a Peco Foods plant in Bay Springs, Miss., told immigration officials that she had come to the state because people in Mexico had told her that jobs were available at the chicken plants there.
In cases cited in the affidavits, people on ICE's electronic-monitoring programs were not authorized to work. But according to the affidavits, dozens of employees in such programs were found working at the seven chicken plants in 2018 and 2019. One successful job applicant was told by a supervisor during her interview that she would need to keep her ankle monitor charged while she worked.
Immigration officials in Jackson, Miss., say they investigated the plants by working with employees who were acting as confidential informants, coordinating with local police on traffic stops and culling records from jails and detention centers, among other forms of surveillance.
Since 2008, Mississippi has required companies to use E-Verify, a federal employment verification system that checks an applicant's information against a variety of federal databases. However, the system only checks the names, Social Security numbers and other information supplied by the applicant, so it cannot always detect whether an employee's application uses falsified documents.
Koch Foods, Peco Foods and PH Food issued public statements saying that they use the federal system, which compares an employee's identity across databases. One of the search warrants lists the names of 25 PH Food employees whose names had not been run through E-Verify.
On Friday, Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr and acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan asking for documents detailing the cost of the raids, information on the detained workers and any past or current criminal charges against the companies that employed them.
"It appears that these DOJ and ICE enforcement actions are targeting only immigrant workers and not their employers," the letter reads.
Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) is one of the top two recipients in Congress of campaign contributions from the egg and poultry industry, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. The Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith's campaign is a top recipient of donations from the National Chicken Council PAC, to which both Peco Foods and Koch Foods executives donate.
Hyde-Smith, a former Mississippi agriculture commissioner, did not respond to requests for comment from The Post.
Here's what the newly unsealed federal documents allege about the five companies whose plants were raided Aug. 7:
Headquartered near Chicago, privately held Koch Foods produces more than 700,000 tons of chicken products each year in its plant in Morton, Miss. The Koch Foods plant in Morton was raided after immigration officials said they received multiple tips that the plant knew it was employing immigrants not authorized to work in the United States.
Officials have reported 144 encounters, including arrests, since 2002 with undocumented immigrants who said they worked at a Koch Foods plant in Mississippi. ICE found that 21 employees of the Koch Foods plant in Morton are enrolled in the agency's electronic-monitoring program, which tracks people who have been arrested on immigration violations and are awaiting court dates. Except in rare cases, such individuals are not authorized to work.
A Guatemalan woman who worked at the Morton plant since November 2016 told immigration officials in May that when she applied for employment, her first application was denied.
"She was told by a Human Resources (HR) employee (unidentified female) at the plant that if the 'papers' were not good, she was not going to be hired," according to the affidavit by agent Williams.          
About three weeks later, the woman used another name to send application materials to the same Koch human resources employee and was hired. "Even though she returned to the plant within three weeks and used two different identities, the HR employee did not ask anything related to her identity," it says.
The Guatemalan woman told authorities that a Koch supervisor asked her whether she had an electronic-monitoring ankle bracelet, which she did. The supervisor told her "he knew 'they' were poor and came to the United States to work," according to the affidavit.
Officials also talked to a Guatemalan woman who said that she first worked at the Koch Foods plant in Morton in 2017. She received permission to work from the Department of Homeland Security in 2018 and asked a co-worker whether she should talk to human resources about changing her employment documents to reflect her real name. The co-worker advised her to quit and reapply instead. So she did and was hired the same day at the other Koch plant in Morton, with no questions about her identity.
Koch spokesman Jim Gilliland told The Post that Koch Foods risked violating federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of national origin for requesting documents beyond what an applicant provides, if those materials appear authentic.
"Forms of identification can look completely authentic and jibe with the person who is sitting in front of us. ... So you take what you're given, and you enter that into the E-Verify system," Gilliland said.
He said the company never knowingly employed people who presented false documentation to work.
This is not the first time federal immigration agents have raided a Koch Foods plant: 161 employees were arrested in 2007 at a plant in Fairfield, Ohio. The company paid a fine of more than $500,000 for violating immigration laws in 2010, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Alabama-based Peco Foods, the eighth-largest poultry producer in the country, operated three of the Mississippi processing plants raided last week. The privately operated company is headed by President Mark Hickman, whose grandfather founded the company in 1937.
"We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and are navigating a potential disruption of operations," the company told The Post in a statement.
According to the search warrant affidavits, 21 people enrolled in the electronic-monitoring program are employed at Peco plants in Mississippi. Authorities had 222 encounters with undocumented Peco employees between 2002 and 2019, the affidavits state.
Officials linked at least seven undocumented Guatemalans to one of the plants, including a worker who said he worked there for 12 years.
Since 2012, immigration officials reported encountering at least five undocumented Mexicans and Guatemalans who said they worked at the Peco plants in Bay Springs and Canton, Miss. Federal investigators worked with a former employee at the company's Bay Springs plant as a confidential informant to videotape a conversation with a Peco Foods human resources employee, who said the plant has hired multiple employees twice but with different identities.
             According to the affidavit, the human resources employee told the informant: "Peco Foods management does not care" about employing immigrants with questionable documentation.
             The affidavit lists ICE's first contact with the Sebastopol plant as July 2014, when officials asked a human resources manager to locate a Guatemalan man using someone else's name for his employment. ICE arrested the man and reported encounters with at least nine more undocumented Guatemalans between August 2015 and June 2019 who said they worked at the plant.
In the affidavit, Williams states that two of the plants ICE raided last week are owned by the same man: Huo You Liang, also known as "Victor" Liang. The chicken-processing plants are A&B, in Pelahatchie, Miss., and PH Food, in Morton, Miss.
A man who answered the phone at PH Food on Thursday asked whether a reporter was calling and before hanging up said he could not answer questions. A&B did not respond to requests for comment.
PH Food, which lost dozens of workers to arrest Aug. 7, laid off another 100 workers on Monday without explanation, attorneys for several workers told The Post. It is unclear whether the layoffs are related to the raid. Former employees and their allies gathered in a Morton park on Tuesday for a demonstration.
In February, an employee at PH Food gave immigration officials information showing that both plants were employing workers without legal documentation and that they use a payroll company in Louisiana to file the paperwork and shift the blame.
In May, officials recorded a conversation between the informant and Heather Carrillo, whom the affidavit lists as the secretary responsible for new employee paperwork at both plants. Carrillo told the informant that if immigration authorities had questions, she would direct them to Shreveport, La., where the payroll company is located, the affidavit states.          
In May, immigration officials reviewed E-Verify records for the names and Social Security numbers given by 20 PH Food employees. They found that neither PH Foods nor its payroll provider had checked E-Verify for those names, even though the companies searched 1,000 other names in the system.
The Louisiana payroll company - PMI Resource - as well as PH Food and A&B "do not verify the authenticity of their documents," according to the affidavit. Although E-Verify is federally a voluntary system, Mississippi state law requires companies to use E-Verify.
Despite the affidavit's allegation that at least 20 employees' names were not put through E-Verify, Carrillo told The Post last week that the business uses E-Verify in hiring. A woman who answered the phone at PMI Resource on Wednesday declined to answer questions.
Both the informant and an undocumented employee said 70 of 80 total employees at A & B's plant were undocumented immigrants, most from Guatemala and a few from Mexico. The affidavit states that 224 of 240 PH Food workers are "suspected to be" undocumented, with 22 employees at the two plants enrolled in ICE's electronic-monitoring program.
The fifth company whose employees were swept up in the ICE raids, Pearl River Foods, opened its plant in Carthage, Miss., two years ago, and its success has been touted by the state's governor.
When the Carthage plant handed over information about its 337 employees to immigration authorities in February, investigators allege they found some employees using the names and Social Security numbers of other people, including the deceased. Three months later, when ICE asked for the plant's E-Verify list, 306 employees were listed as having been previously searched in the system.
The affidavit said 19 undocumented employees were enrolled in the electronic-monitoring program.
Pearl River opened its $2 million chicken-processing plant in 2017 and created 600 jobs within a year, according to a              news release by the state economic development authority.
"The addition of so many new jobs by Pearl River Foods in Leake County speaks to the company's commitment to doing business in Mississippi and to its strong belief in the people of our great state," Gov. Phil Bryant (R) said at the time.
The business writes Facebook posts in English and Spanish and received an award in June from the state for its contributions to economic development. Pearl River Foods did not respond to requests for comment, and its Facebook page was no longer publicly available as of Thursday.

How President Trump's new immigration rule could erode the social safety net; The new rule dramatically expands the meaning of public charge.

                             Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that the Border Patrol was founded in 1929. It was actually founded in 1924.                        
This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new "public charge" rule aimed at disqualifying applicants legally in the United States from obtaining green cards that will enable them to stay permanently. People who access certain social services such as Medicaid, housing vouchers and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (food stamps) - or who are determined likely to access them in the future - may be deemed by immigration officials "more likely than not" to become a public charge, or dependent on government social programs, and denied a green card.
Although the U.S. government has long tried to restrict the legal immigration of poor people and has severely restricted immigrants' access to social services, the new rule is still stunning in its potential effect. Immigrants may be forced to choose between accessing services for which they qualify and applying for lawful immigration status. The mere appearance of poverty or even the potential for it may become the basis for a denied petition.
What is different about this most recent interpretation of a very old immigration law, however, is not just that it enacts a wealth test on potential migrants, but that it does so by placing benefits and support services widely considered critical to public health and human dignity on the line. In closely tying the mere potential for public dependence to moral failure, the Trump administration attacks not only immigrants, but the very legitimacy of the social safety net.
The Trump administration is innovating using a long-standing element of immigration law. Although the classification of some immigrants as "liable to become a public charge" as a basis for their exclusion was formally entered into the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1882, the so-called public charge rule found its most relevant precursor in the 1875 Page Act. The Page Act, which barred the entry of all Chinese women into the United States on the basis of their potential for immoral conduct, was the first federal restriction on free migration into the country and the end of relatively open borders.
Driving the legislation were white American anxieties about cheap Chinese contract labor, racial intermixing and sex work. The law's sponsor, Rep. Horace Page, argued that Chinese men accepted wages that were too low to support a spouse, leaving East Asian women susceptible to becoming sex workers. Because Chinese women were presumed to be too impoverished to support themselves by legal means and therefore might become reliant on charity or state assistance, they were barred. By 1882, Congress had also banned Chinese men from entering the country, too, and implanted the phrase "public charge" in federal immigration law, where it has remained ever since.
This was the same period during which the immigration enforcement bureaucracy arose. It expanded with the establishment of the Border Patrol in 1924 and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in 1933. These expansions came along with the development of screening procedures and a body of scientific knowledge that purportedly enabled officials to document and root out a range of "undesirable" qualities. The INS marshaled a growing body of psychological science to exclude suspected homosexuals, for example, on the basis that they were likely to become public charges because of their "perversion."
This practice became codified in the McCarren-Walter Act of 1952. This exclusion of homosexuals, like the earlier exclusion of Asian women, demonstrates that being denied entry because one might become a public charge was about far more than economic circumstances. It was actually about excluding those who were racially, sexually or politically undesirable at a given moment.
This predisposition didn't change when Congress liberalized American immigration laws in the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act by abolishing the national origins quota system. In fact, this change was mainly possible because it implemented a system based on family reunification, which explicitly alleviated the concerns underlying the public charge idea.
Framing immigrants as members of a family was an effective method of securing liberalized immigration laws because it made them seem nonthreatening and, in the minds of many Americans, unlikely to burden society. Familial reunification implied that a sponsoring citizen would be a breadwinner supporting an immigrant spouse or nonworking parents. These new migrants would be dependent on their sponsoring family members, and therefore pose no threat of competition with U.S. workers for jobs - and would be unlikely to rely on taxpayer-funded social services.
But framing immigration this way worked around the ideas underlying the public charge restriction, without weakening the political potency of the idea that immigrants were using and even abusing welfare. This choice would set the stage for far greater scrutiny of the link between marriage and immigration in the decades to come.
Nowhere was this clearer than in discussions of both marriage and welfare fraud in hearings for the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. INS Commissioner Alan Nelson testified that immigrants were entering into falsified "green card marriages" to illegally obtain welfare benefits. Citing newspaper reports and mere suspicions as well as verified cases, Nelson claimed immigrants were abusing the family unification system to obtain student loans, food stamps, subsidized housing, in-state tuition and other support services. The resulting legislation contained several safeguards against marriage fraud - including mandatory waiting periods and green-card marriage interviews.
Like the "welfare queen" that Ronald Reagan had invoked to win election, Nelson's testimony before Congress and his comments to the news media constructed a deceptive immigrant who "used" and then discarded a U.S. citizen spouse to gain access to the bounty of the American welfare state. The only problem? It was a fictional image, one that relied on existing racial tropes and assumptions about welfare use, without any research to support the idea that a real problem of any scale existed.
Following his time at the INS, Nelson returned to California to help author the notorious Proposition 187, a controversial ballot measure that barred undocumented migrants from accessing basic public benefits, including public schools and non-emergency medical services. Prop 187 passed in 1994 by nearly a nine-point margin. It was backed heartily by California's Republican governor, Pete Wilson who cited the 1990s recession as a reason taxpayers could no longer support immigrant "dependency." The measure never took effect - it was widely criticized as cruel and racist, a judge issued an injunction blocking it, and it was largely overturned as unconstitutional.
But the idea of the illegitimate immigrant, abusing the system, endured. Policymakers invoked the figure repeatedly, as part of their effort to transform welfare more broadly, as in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 and to undermine immigrant rights, as in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Acts of the same year. Together these laws, among other harsh measures, barred immigrants from accessing most social services. These reforms also made use of cash benefits, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a permitted basis for denying an immigrant's green card petition.
It was not a coincidence that Clinton-era welfare reforms made it nearly impossible for immigrants to legally access cash assistance at a time when those benefits were coming under attack as a whole. Those demanding welfare reform framed welfare recipients not as full members of society in need of assistance, but instead as personally culpable for their poverty and prone to fraud. By this logic, immigrants who claimed welfare had revealed themselves to be cut from a similar cloth - and therefore weren't worthy of inclusion in the United States.
The new DHS rule builds upon this dubious mischaracterization. It threatens the most fundamental blocks of our social safety net: the right to food, the right to shelter and the right to medical care by painting immigrants who need any support in these areas as deviant and dependent. Conflating economic hardship with moral failure is an old tactic that has long been used to target immigrants. But by extending it to these most fundamental elements of public support, the new rule risks scaring people away from using critically important services that are often the difference between life and death, eroding the larger premise of the social safety net.

It's the mainstream anti-immigration rhetoric, not the extreme, that's shaping American politics; It's one of the strongest examples of the Trump-Fox News feedback loop.

In the aftermath of the mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart, in which the accused gunman allegedly targeted Hispanics, there's been a great deal of focus on a short screed he appears to have posted online shortly before opening fire. In that document, the author claims that immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border is an "invasion" and that white American culture is at risk of being "replaced."
In short order, observers noted that the rhetoric echoed President Trump's own descriptions of the purported dangers of immigration. Trump has repeatedly spoken about immigrant invaders and has, on several occasions, warned Republicans that they were at risk of being swamped by immigrants coming into the United States to vote Democratic - even if they have to vote illegally. (There's no evidence that this has happened more than a few times in recent years.)
The focus on the language used in that document, though, obscures the more important factor driving immigration politics in the United States: the mainstream rhetoric used to disparage or undercut immigration.
On Monday, the Trump administration announced plans to restrict access to green cards for immigrants by adding restrictions focusing on ensuring that new arrivals could immediately begin working and not need to use government resources. In an interview on NPR, the administration's immigration chief, Ken Cuccinelli, offered a reworking of the poem that sits at the base of the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge."
It's this sort of rhetoric that's driving the administration's policies and Republican attitudes toward immigration - and is mirrored by conservative media.
We noted on Monday that the effort to add new restrictions on immigration centered on the use of public-support systems was central to how many in the tea party viewed the issue of immigration. While Trump's entry into national Republican politics is generally pegged to his aborted 2012 presidential run and his embrace of the false claim that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States, Trump was also a supporter of the tea party movement.
The period from 2010 to 2014 was formative for Trump's conservative politics (as it was for many Americans). From 2011 until he launched his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump had a weekly gig on Fox News's "Fox and Friends," contributing his thoughts on a number of issues in line with the show's politics. He was tracking more conservative online outlets such as Breitbart, occasionally sharing stories published there. In 2013, he spoke with Breitbart's Matt Boyle (who later became a publicly visible supporter of Trump's), arguing that Republicans should oppose an immigration reform proposal, lest future Democrats flood across the border - rhetoric used in the screed published before the El Paso shooting.
             In 2014, violence in Central America prompted a surge in the number of children arriving at the border seeking entry to the United States. Immigration as an issue quickly dominated Fox News, conservative outlets such as Breitbart and conservative radio. Former Virginia congressman Eric Cantor, then the House majority leader, lost a Republican primary that June in part because of a relentless focus by conservative media on his approach to immigration, which was perceived as overly generous.
This focus on immigration in the conservative media certainly contributed to Trump's focus on the issue during his campaign launch in June 2015. Analysis of closed-captioning data from the major cable news networks and PBS compiled by the GDELT Project shows that Fox News talked about immigration in the context of illegality more than 2,000 times in 2014. In the first half of 2015, that plunged to about 500 - but after Trump jumped into the race and, more specifically, after blowback against his anti-immigration rhetoric elevated his national profile, the network talked about illegal immigration or undocumented immigrants nearly 1,800 times in the second half of the year.
Trump's entry into the race similarly spurred more discussion of illegal immigration on the other networks, too.
Immigration has been a constant foil for Trump during his presidency, echoed and amplified on Fox News in particular. As the 2018 midterm approached, Trump highlighted caravans of immigrants approaching the border as an imminent threat, sending troops to border states to put up concertina wire. Fox News obliged, showing footage from the border and implying that the group was rife with criminals and potential terrorists. After the midterms, Trump was prepared to sign a budget deal until hard-liners in conservative media pressured him to try to get funding for a wall on the border. The longest government shutdown in history ensued, with Trump eventually conceding defeat.
This has had an effect. Shortly after the administration announced the shift in immigration policy discussed by Cuccinelli, the Pew Research Center released new polling about views of immigrants in the United States. Republicans are consistently more likely to hold skeptical views of immigrants in the country without authorization than are Americans overall: They're more likely to think immigrants are taking American jobs (which Trump and his administration have claimed), are not as hard-working or honest and are more likely to commit crimes (which Trump has claimed repeatedly). There's no evidence that undocumented immigrants take jobs from native-born citizens, and immigrants to the United States commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.
Notice what's happened during Trump's presidency. When Pew asked in August 2016 - months into Trump's political rhetoric - Republicans were 37 percentage points more likely to say that immigrants were hard-working than not and 10 points more likely to say they weren't more prone to committing crime.
Now? Republicans are 12 percentage points more likely to say that immigrants are hard-working, a 25-point swing. Republicans are now more likely to say that immigrants commit crime at higher rates than citizens than to say that they don't.
We can't run an experiment to see what those numbers would look like without Trump in the White House. Would Fox News have been as fervent on the subject? Would some other Republican have made it as significant a priority?
One thing is clear. We've spent more than a week debating the extent to which Trump's rhetoric influenced the El Paso shooter. There's little question, though, that his rhetoric has shifted how Republicans broadly view immigrants to the United States leading to an administration official literally suggesting that the wording on the Statue of Liberty was too generous to those seeking to come to the United States.
That administration official, Cuccinelli, has ancestors who came to the United States from Italy and Ireland, like those of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway. Those two groups were targets of anti-immigrant rhetoric more than a century ago, seen as dangerous infiltrators aiming to steal American jobs.

             With Mariana Alfaro          
             THE BIG IDEA: President Trump is building his reelection campaign around the same brand of nativism that energized tens of millions of aggrieved whites and got him elected in 2016. Because of the verities of the electoral college, there is a body of evidence that suggests doubling down on an agenda of exclusion will work in 2020. But three new polls also pinpoint fault lines within the GOP on the immigration issue that the president's opponents might capitalize on - if they're able to figure out how to swim against the leftward rip current that threatens to drown the eventual Democratic nominee.
             -- A Gallup poll released this morning shows growing support for allowing refugees from Central America into the United States. In December, 51 percent of Americans approved of accepting refugees from the countries in the Northern Triangle, which refers to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Now it's 57 percent. Democrats remain overwhelmingly supportive - more than 8 in 10 say America's doors should be open - but the number of Republicans who say they want to take in Central American refugees has risen from 14 percent to 24 percent. Approval among independents also increased from 52 percent in December to 58 percent today.
"Support for allowing Central American refugees entry is now higher than Gallup has found for most refugee cases it has polled on historically, including Syrian refugees in 2015 as well as stretching back to refugees from the German Holocaust in the 1930s and 40s," said Gallup analyst Justin McCarthy. "If support for Central American refugee entry continues to increase, this could jeopardize Trump's immigration-related initiatives."
While 52 percent of Republicans surveyed by Gallup say that what's happening at our southern border is a "crisis" - Trump's preferred word - another 36 percent say it's more appropriate to characterize what's going on as "a major problem."
             -- A Pew Research Center poll published yesterday afternoon shows that, while there is overwhelming support on the right for reducing the total number of people coming into the United States from Central America, 37 percent of Republicans want to make it easier for those who are seeking asylum from those countries to be granted legal status. As a reminder, asylum seekers are legal immigrants who are seeking to enter the United States on the grounds that their lives are in danger if they stay in their native land.
             A sizable 44 percent minority of Republicans said that the Trump administration is doing a bad job at dealing with the increased number of asylum seekers at the border. The majority, 55 percent, said the government is doing a good job. As a point of comparison, 84 percent of Democrats agree that the government is doing a bad job. (Across the board, Trump's immigration policies continue to be overwhelmingly, sometimes close to unanimously, unpopular among Democrats.)
             -- Quinnipiac University's most recent national poll found that 42 percent of Republicans believe that the conditions in immigration detention centers at the southern border are a serious problem, while 43 percent do not think so. Another 14 percent are not sure. Overall, 68 percent of respondents in the poll - released the week before last - said the conditions are a serious problem and 23 percent said they are not. The Q-poll found that 49 percent of Republicans believe immigration is good for the country while 32 percent say it's bad. Overall, 70 percent of Americans think immigration is a net positive while 17 percent - mostly Republicans - think it's bad.
             -- In other notable dividing lines, the Pew poll found that a 51 percent majority of Republicans want the federal government to provide more assistance to the countries in Central America             where most of the asylum seekers are coming from. This could help alleviate some of the underlying problems that are prompting so many people to embark on the dangerous journey north. But Trump has pushed relentlessly to cut this aid. Experts warn that this may exacerbate the already terrible conditions on the ground and thereby make the U.S. an even stronger magnet for the folks he wants to deter.
             -- On three questions posed by the Pew poll, Republicans were split on the character of undocumented immigrants: They are almost evenly divided on the question of whether undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes than U.S. citizens, with 49 percent saying they are and 46 percent saying they're not. Trump has peddled the false narrative that immigrants writ large are more violent, and the prime-time hosts on Fox News have abetted him in this, but several studies have shown that's not the case.
While 42 percent of Republicans say that undocumented immigrants are not as honest and hard-working as U.S. citizens, 54 percent say they are just as honest and hard-working - if not more so.
While 64 percent of Republicans say undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that U.S. citizens don't want to do, 32 percent say they're taking away jobs that U.S. citizens would be willing to do if they had the chance.
             -- Bigger picture, the Pew poll found that 40 percent of Americans say they agree with the Democratic Party's approach to "illegal immigration" and 39 percent say they agree with the Republican Party's. The rest - 1 in 5 U.S. adults - say they disagree with both parties. Three in 4 Republicans say they generally agree with their party's approach to "illegal immigration," the term used by the pollsters, but stark differences emerged when the pollsters drilled into details and asked about specifics.
             Republican partisans have moved Trump's direction somewhat in their general attitudes toward immigration, a reflection of the power of any president's bully pulpit and the potency of this president's anti-immigration fixation. In March 2017, soon after Trump took office, Pew found 61 percent of Republicans believed there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally if certain requirements are met. That's slipped to 54 percent in the poll released yesterday. Now, 45 percent of Republicans say undocumented immigrants should not be allowed to stay here. Democratic views are unchanged: About 9 in 10 of them supported a path to citizenship then and still do now.
"In a follow-up question, most of those who are against a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants say they would support a national law enforcement effort to deport all immigrants who are now living in the U.S. illegally," Pew's pollsters write in a note accompanying their data. "Overall, 23% of the public opposes legal status for undocumented immigrants and supports a national effort to deport all immigrants living in the country illegally. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 42% - including nearly half (49%) of conservative Republicans -- would support an effort to deport all undocumented immigrants in the U.S."
             -- To be sure, there is an undeniable constituency inside the GOP for treating migrants with some degree of cruelty, but they are in the minority. For example, just over a quarter of Republicans in the Pew poll do not think it is important for the federal government to provide safe and sanitary conditions for asylum seekers. Another 41 percent of Republicans say it's "somewhat" important that people get safe and sanitary conditions while in U.S. government custody, and 32 percent say it's very important. For context, more than 90 percent of Democrats say it's important that asylum seekers receive access to safe and sanitary conditions.
The federal government is required under a consent decree to provide "safe and sanitary" conditions to migrant children. But a Justice Department lawyer argued during a June court hearing, which went viral, that the federal government is not legally required to provide toothbrushes, soap or towels to fulfill that requirement because those amenities were not explicitly mentioned in the 1997 agreement.
             MORE FROM THE FRONT LINES ON THE IMMIGRATION WARS:          
             -- Immigrants who live legally in the United States and use public benefits - such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing assistance - could find it harder to get a green card under a policy change unveiled yesterday by the Trump administration.Abigail Hauslohner, Nick Miroff, Maria Sacchetti and Tracy Jan report: "The new criteria for 'Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,' due to take effect Oct. 15, will set stricter standards for applicants seeking legal permanent residency in the United States, criteria that will skew the process in favor of the highly skilled, high-income immigrants Trump covets. ... 'Through the public charge rule, President Trump's administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America,' said acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli. ...
             "Analysts say the public charge change could dramatically reduce family-based legal immigration to the United States, particularly from Latin America and Africa, where incomes are generally lower than the rest of the world. It also could lead to an increase in deportations, as those present with some form of provisional or temporary immigration status in the United States are denied legal residency. ... Advocates for immigrants say the new rule could narrow the pool of people who are eligible for green cards, which are necessary to get on the path to U.S. citizenship, effectively blocking immigrants who live in poverty from having a chance at naturalization. ... Cuccinelli said the change would benefit U.S. taxpayers by selecting better candidates for U.S. citizenship."          
             -- "Trump's claim that he supports legal immigration turns out to be a lie,"Eugene Robinson writes in his column: "Long advocated by White House adviser Stephen Miller, the Torquemada of the immigration inquisition, the new policy is a major step in Trump's crusade to Make America White Again. If it survives court challenges, the new rule could dramatically reduce legal - I repeat, legal - immigration from low-income countries. Not just coincidentally, I am sure, this means fewer black and brown people would be granted resident status. Trump's message to the world: Keep your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. As he memorably and disgracefully put it: 'Our Country is FULL!'"
             -- Our              Arelis Hernández             got a glimpse inside the Central Processing Center, the Border Patrol's largest holding facility, where nearly 1,300 migrants wait to be released, deported or transferred: "Unaccompanied children are separated by gender and kept in distinct pens, where they have access to crackers, juice and chips. A television runs programming for all hours except mealtimes, and they can choose to don provided sweatpants, T-shirts and shoes. 'Children are held on average about 26 hours in custody,' said Oscar Escamilla, acting deputy Border Patrol agent-in-charge, who led a brief tour through the center ... During the tour, journalists were not permitted to talk to the migrants in custody, and most shied away from the cameras. Many retreated deeper within their pens and turned away. ...
"Parents with children are held in separate enclosures, where dozens of men and women sat on metal benches or laid across gym mats on the concrete floor. ... Tired men bounced little boys on their knees, children munched on apples and others hid beneath blankets in the cell adjacent to a play area with a plastic playpen and a few toys ... Inside each section of cells, a guard monitors camera footage and keeps watch from a small tower elevated about eight feet from the ground. ... Between each holding area is a sanitation station containing about a dozen portable toilets and sinks that are cleaned twice a day. There was no escaping the foul stench of days of accumulated dirt, sweat and waste."
             -- That U.S. Border Patrol agent who intentionally rammed his truck into a Guatemalan migrant in 2017, and referred in text messages to migrants as "subhuman" and "mindless murdering savages," got a plea deal that allowed him to accept guilt for a single misdemeanor charge.From the New York Times: "The agent, Matthew Bowen, who was stationed in Nogales, will face up to one year in prison and could be fined $100,000 when he is sentenced on Oct. 15 for deprivation of rights under color of law, according to the plea agreement. Mr. Bowen also said in the plea agreement that he would resign from the Border Patrol. He was suspended in June 2018."
             -- Guatemala's new president-elect, Alejandro Giammattei, could stir up trouble for Trump on the immigration front.From CNN: "Giammattei has been outspoken in his opposition to a migration deal that his predecessor, Jimmy Morales, signed with the United States last month. ... When does this deal come into force? Signed hastily by the outgoing administration, it has already been opposed by the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, who ruled its Congress has to decide on any safe third country agreements. But it is scheduled to come into effect in mid-August -- unless of course Giammattei sticks to his word and blocks it. But there's a catch: Guatemala's elite. They also have an outsized view, likely heard in the country's corridors of power. The prospect of Trump's wrath -- he has already cut aid to the economically troubled nation, and flatly threatened destructive tariffs if the deal isn't put into force -- will trouble them."
             -- The migrant crisis is moving south, to Mexican border towns, as a result of Trump's "Remain in Mexico" policy.From NPR: "A month ago, if you came to the sun-blasted plaza in Matamoros, Mexico, at the foot of the International Bridge, it would have been full of asylum-seekers waiting to be let into America. They were haggard, but there was hope in their faces. Today they're still here, lying about dejectedly, seeking shade from the brutal summer heat, and they're gloomy about their fate."
             -- But others keep coming: One person is missing after U.S. officials rescued 14 people from the Rio Grande. Three other people were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, and the other 11 members of the group remain in custody. (CNN)
             WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:          
             -- Numerous women accuse opera legend Plá             cido Domingo of pressuring them into sexual relationships and punishing them professionally when they refused his advances.From the AP: "Eight singers and a dancer have told the AP that they were sexually harassed by the long-married, Spanish-born superstar in encounters that took place over three decades beginning in the late 1980s, at venues that included opera companies where he held top managerial positions. One accuser said Domingo stuck his hand down her skirt and three others said he forced wet kisses on their lips - in a dressing room, a hotel room and at a lunch meeting. ... The AP also spoke to almost three dozen other singers, dancers, orchestra musicians, members of backstage staff, voice teachers and an administrator who said they witnessed inappropriate sexually tinged behavior by Domingo and that he pursued younger women with impunity. ...
"Two of the women said they briefly gave in to Domingo's advances, feeling they couldn't risk jeopardizing their careers by saying no to the most powerful man in their profession. One of them said she had sex with him twice, including at the Biltmore hotel in Los Angeles. When Domingo left for a performance, the woman said, he put $10 on the dresser, saying, 'I don't want you to feel like a prostitute, but I also don't want you to have to pay to park.' ... She said the superstar mentioned his 'superstition that he had to be with a woman before a show' to help him relax and calm his nerves. ... She cut off physical contact after the second encounter, a move she is convinced derailed her career at LA Opera. ... Seven of the nine accusers told the AP they feel their careers were adversely impacted after rejecting Domingo's advances. ...
"Domingo did not respond to detailed questions from the AP about specific incidents, but issued a statement saying: 'The allegations from these unnamed individuals dating back as many as thirty years are deeply troubling, and as presented, inaccurate. Still, it is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable - no matter how long ago and despite my best intentions.'"
             THE DOMESTIC AGENDA:          
             -- The Trump administration took its final step to weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, a bedrock law that brought the bald eagle, the American alligator, the California condor, the humpback whale and the grizzly bear back from the brink of extinction.Darryl Fears reports: "New rules will allow the administration to reduce the amount of habitat set aside for wildlife and remove tools that officials use to predict future harm to species as a result of climate change. It would also reveal for the first time in the law's 45-year history the financial costs of protecting them. The long-anticipated changes, jointly announced by the Interior and Commerce departments, were undertaken as part of President Trump's mandate to scale back government regulations on corporations, including the oil and gas industry, that want to drill on protected land.
"Within hours of Monday's announcement, the state attorneys general of California and Massachusetts joined a conservation group, Defenders of Wildlife, in declaring the changes illegal and vowing to challenge them in court. In May, a U.N. report on world biodiversity found that 1 million plant and animal species are on the verge of extinction, with alarming implications for human survival. The report, written by seven experts from universities around the world, directly linked the loss of species to human activity and showed how those losses are undermining food and water security, along with human health. More plants and animals are threatened with extinction now than at any other period in human history, the report said.
"Under the administration's new rules, it would have been nearly impossible to designate the polar bear as threatened in 2010 because of the loss of sea ice in the Arctic, one of the fastest-warming areas in the world. Nearly 200,000 square miles of barrier islands in Alaska were listed as critical habitat. Officials relied on climate models to predict how warming would impact polar bear habitat more than 80 years into the future. The new rules called such predictions into doubt and said officials can now only determine impacts in what it described, vaguely, as the 'foreseeable future.' ... In responses to comments submitted to the proposed rule changes, administration officials argued that they were not discounting climate science, only asserting that climate projections were uncertain.
"The new rules would also limit the area of land that can be protected to help species recover and survive. Currently, land that plants and animals occupy is set aside for their protection, in addition to areas that they once occupied or might need in the future. Now, critical habitat that is not occupied might not be protected, opening it up for oil and gas exploration or other forms of development." Don't kid yourself: That's the whole point of this. It's all about extraction.
             -- Extreme climate change has arrived in America. Steven Mufson, Chris Mooney, Juliet Eilperin and John Muyskens report from Lake Hopatcong, N.J.: "Before climate change thawed the winters of New Jersey, this lake hosted boisterous wintertime carnivals. As many as 15,000 skaters took part, and automobile owners would drive onto the thick ice. ... In those days before widespread refrigeration, workers flocked here to harvest ice. They would carve blocks as much as two feet thick, float them to giant ice houses, sprinkle them with sawdust and load them onto rail cars bound for ice boxes in New York City and beyond. 'These winters do not exist anymore,' says Marty Kane, a lawyer and head of the Lake Hopatcong Foundation. That's because a century of climbing temperatures has changed the character of the Garden State. The massive ice industry and skate sailing association are but black-and-white photographs at the local museum. ... New Jersey may seem an unlikely place to measure climate change, but it is one of the fastest-warming states in the nation. Its average temperature has climbed by close to 2 degrees Celsius since 1895 - double the average for the Lower 48 states. ...          
"Over the past two decades, the 2 degrees Celsius number has emerged as a critical threshold for global warming. ... A Washington Post analysis of more than a century of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature data across the Lower 48 states and 3,107 counties has found that major areas are nearing or have already crossed the 2-degree Celsius mark. ... To find the world's 2C hot spots, its fastest-warming places, The Post analyzed temperature databases, including those kept by NASA and NOAA; peer-reviewed scientific studies; and reports by local climatologists. The global data sets draw upon thousands of land-based weather stations and other measurements, such as ocean buoys armed with sensors and ship logs dating as far back as 1850. In any one geographic location, 2 degrees Celsius may not represent global cataclysmic change, but it can threaten ecosystems, change landscapes and upend livelihoods and cultures."          
             -- A friend of the Dayton shooter bought him body armor and helped him assemble his weapon, the FBI said.Mark Berman reports: "Those details were included in a criminal complaint charging the friend - Ethan Kollie, 24 - with two counts related to his purchase and possession of firearms. Neither count relates to the shooting itself. Benjamin C. Glassman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, stressed that while the charges emerged from the investigation into the Dayton shooting, they included no suggestion that Kollie knowingly played a role in plotting the attack. 'Mr. Kollie does not stand accused of intentionally participating in the planning of that shooting,' Glassman said at a news briefing. 'We have no evidence of that. There's no allegation of that.' ... Jail records showed that Kollie was arrested Friday evening, the same day the criminal complaint was filed. Kollie was charged with possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of a controlled substance and making a false statement regarding firearms."
             -- A fourth member of the National Rifle Association's board resigned amid upheaval.Tom Hamburger reports: "Professional sport shooter Julie Golob, a regular on shooting shows who has won multiple competitions and is an advocate for women's use of firearms, did not state a reason for her departure in a note posted on her website. 'I am proud to have had the opportunity to represent the members of the NRA but I can no longer commit to fulfilling the duties of a director,' she wrote. ... The NRA has a 76-member board of directors, most of whom continue to defend the current NRA leadership, which has been under siege in recent months."
             -- Attorney General Bill Barr lashed out against the "failure" of federal prison officials to keep Jeffrey Epstein alive.Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Rachel Weiner report: "Barr's comments underscored the increasing scrutiny on the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, where Epstein, 66, was found hanging in his cell on Saturday. ... Barr made clear, too, that federal prosecutors' investigation of those who might have facilitated Epstein's alleged sex abuse of minors will continue, even if Epstein can no longer be prosecuted. Epstein was in jail awaiting a trial on new federal sex trafficking charges. ... Speaking to law enforcement officials in New Orleans, the country's top law enforcement official said he 'was appalled . . . and, frankly, angry' to learn of the Metropolitan Correctional Center's 'failure to adequately secure' Epstein."
             -- "The Day Jeffrey Epstein Told Me He Had Dirt on Powerful People,"from the Times's James Stewart: "Almost exactly a year ago, on Aug. 16, 2018, I visited Jeffrey Epstein at his cavernous Manhattan mansion. The overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it. He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use. So one of my first thoughts on hearing of Mr. Epstein's suicide was that many prominent men and at least a few women must be breathing sighs of relief that whatever Mr. Epstein knew, he has taken it with him."
             -- Nearly 35 billion opioids - half of the pills distributed in the country - were handled by just 15 percent of pharmacies.Jenn Abelson, Andrew Ba Tran, Beth Reinhard and Aaron C. Davis report: "With the release and analysis of a federal database tracking every pain pill sold in the United States at the height of the opioid crisis, one Clinton County pharmacy has come into sharp focus: Shearer Drug [in Albany, Ky.] ... The family-run pharmacy purchased nearly 6.8 million pills that contained hydrocodone and oxycodone from 2006 through 2012 - enough to give 96 pills each year to every person in the county of roughly 10,000 residents. During this period, Shearer Drug procured more opioid pills on a per capita basis per county than any other retail pharmacy in the United States ... Shearer Drug is among thousands of small, independent pharmacies - from Smith County Drug Center in Carthage, Tenn., to Zion Pharmacy in Kanab, Utah - that handled large volumes of hydrocodone and oxycodone from 2006 through 2012 and until now have largely avoided publicity for their roles in the epidemic. ... Some of the pharmacies reviewed by The Post have had trouble with regulators or law enforcement, but for others there is no public record of any scrutiny by authorities."
             -- If you want to know how many pain pills went to your pharmacy, a team of Post reporters and designers created a searchable database that you can find             here.          
             --             In an op-ed for the Times             , former Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) called on the Senate to abolish the filibuster in all its forms, saying it is "suffocating" the will of the American people: "If a Democratic president wants to tackle the most important issues facing our country, then he or she must have the ability to do so - and that means curtailing Republicans' ability to stifle the will of the American people. It's time to allow a simple majority vote instead of the 60-vote threshold now required for legislation. When the American people demand change and elect a new Senate, a new majority leader must be able to respond to that call and pass legislation. The list of issues stalled by the Senate filibuster is enormous - and still growing."
             -- The U.S. budget deficit is up 27 percent - another $119.7 billion - meaning it is inching closer to hitting $1 trillion.From CNBC: "That brings the fiscal year deficit through July to $866.8 billion, a little over a year and a half after the Trump administration ushered through a $1.5 trillion tax cut that the White House has vowed would pay for itself. At this point last year, the deficit was $684 billion."
             THE NEW WORLD ORDER:           
             -- Protesters reoccupied the Hong Kong airport today, disrupting flights for a second day of demonstrations.Gerry Shih and Timothy McLaughlin report: "After mass cancellations the previous evening, flights had been gradually returning to normal throughout Tuesday, though still with disruptions, as thousands of black-clad demonstrators sat in the terminal with placards denouncing police brutality and calling for freedom for Hong Kong. But by early evening, with protesters using luggage carts as barricades and blocking departing passengers, airport authorities said they were 'temporarily suspending' check-in at both terminals. Arguments erupted between passengers and protesters, with some passengers crying and saying they just wanted to get home. ...
             "Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader, said the city risked being 'pushed into an abyss.' As the summer of unrest rolls on, the situation is becoming increasingly tense. Statements from Chinese government officials and state media have grown steadily more shrill, accusing protesters of 'terrorism' and warning of an impending crackdown in the semiautonomous financial center."
             -- The Post's Editorial Board calls on Chinese President Xi Jinping to open serious negotiations with the protesters on their demands, which it calls quite reasonable: "Cinching the noose ever tighter, as the Chinese government has done in recent weeks, is the pathway to a dead end that could harm both Hong Kong and mainland China economically as well as politically. A cliff looms, and China's leaders should turn back before it is too late."
             -- Big brands are apologizing to China for identifying the semiautonomous territory - and other Chinese-claimed lands  as independent countries.Jennifer Hassan and Anna Fifield report: "From Versace to Givenchy, brands have swiftly offered apologies to China over their references to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao on their websites and on items of clothing. The online backlash and calls to boycott the brands come at a highly sensitive time for China, with Hong Kong rocked by protests - which kicked off in June - over concerns that Beijing is encroaching on the territory's autonomy."
             -- Stocks dipped on fears that Trump's trade war could hasten a looming global recession.From Thomas Heath: "'The escalating trade tensions, combined with low volume and traditionally weaker-than-average price returns in August and September, are contributing to a re-test of last week's low for the S&P 500,' said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. ... Several factors have contributed to the market turbulence in recent sessions, including China's threat to devalue its currency, massive protests in Hong Kong that could prompt a response from the Chinese government, an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war and a flight to bonds. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said he does not expect a U.S.-China trade deal before the 2020 election in a note he released over the weekend. ... Monday's decline follows a turbulent start to August, which is historically one of the worst months of the year for stocks. But the trade war with China is casting a pall over the global economy, threatening a decade-long U.S. boom that had pushed stocks to all-time highs."
             -- Bank of America sees a greater than 30 percent chance that the economy will fall into a recession in the next year, partly as a result of the trade war and a global economic slowdown. (CNBC)
             -- Such a recession could undermine Trump's reelection,writes Aaron Blake: "His approval rating already languishes in the low to mid-40s, even with a strong economy and an unemployment rate at 3.7 percent. ... We're so polarized that a slight downturn in the economy might not cost him a huge amount of support - especially if he can persuade his supporters to blame the Federal Reserve or that the trade war is worth the momentary economic pain - but he simply can't afford to lose much support, period."
             -- Farmers support Trump's tariff fight, even though they don't think it helps them.From NBC News: "For months, analysts have been wondering if the economic hits farmers are taking might come back to bite the White House. Up to now, anecdotal reporting has shown little erosion of support for Trump and a survey from academics at Iowa State University of 700 farmers in Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota seems to back that reporting. The survey, led by ISU Professor Wendong Zhang, found that 57 percent of those farmers somewhat or strongly supported the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that brought retaliatory tariffs from the Chinese government. Another 14 percent had neutral feelings about them. Only 30 percent somewhat or strongly opposed the tariffs ... [But] only 14 percent of the farmers surveyed said, a year from now, 'My farm operation will be better off financially because of this trade disruption.' And only 20 percent said that, in a year, 'U.S. agriculture will be better off compared to now because of this trade disruption.' Meanwhile, more than three quarters said, 'American farmers will bear the brunt of the tariffs imposed by the Chinese government.'"
             -- Here's some good news: Scientists say Ebola is no longer "incurable" after the discovery of two highly effective drugs.Claire Parker reports: "The drugs, tested in a nearly nine-month clinical trial, have performed so well that health professionals will now administer them to every patient in Congo. ... Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, a Congolese doctor who has spent his career researching Ebola treatments and oversaw the trial on the ground, said in a conference call Monday that he 'could not have imagined' that such a day would come. 'From now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable,' he said. But in a place where suspicion of health workers and violent conflict are widespread, finding effective medical therapies is only half the battle, experts say."
             -- Russia held funerals for five of the nuclear workers who died while testing a new missile that some international observers believe could've been a new nuclear weapon.Will Englund reports: "Russian officials said they will try to determine what went wrong and how to avoid another such accident in the future. ... Also Monday, Valentin Kostyukov, director of the center in Sarov, said on local television that researchers from the institute had been working at the northern test site for a year. Rosatom's chief, Alexei Likhachev, said work on the new weapon would continue, without specifying what that weapon is."
             -- A 65-year-old former Pakistani military officer has been credited with stopping a gunman from attacking a mosque in Norway.Rick Noack reports: "Mohammad Rafiq said he threw the gunman to the ground after the man entered the al-Noor Islamic Center in Baerum near the Norwegian capital of Oslo on Saturday, before the two other men inside the mosque rushed to help him pin down the gunman. ... The attempted attack on the al-Noor center happened a day before Muslims around the world celebrate Eid al-Adha, one of the most important holidays on the Islamic calendar marking the end of the Hajj pilgrimage. Rafiq and the two others had been at the al-Noor mosque preparing for the festivities."
             -- India continues silencing those who oppose its crackdown on Kashmir.From Nina Masih and Joanna Slater: "Ever since India announced a move to strip Kashmir of its autonomy one week ago, residents of this disputed region have been unable to make phone calls, access the Internet or move freely. They also have heard nothing from local political leaders, because many of them have been detained and held incommunicado, part of an unprecedented clampdown that has muffled the public response to India's decision. ... To maintain control, India has sent thousands of additional troops to Kashmir and detained hundreds of local politicians and party workers."

             -- "These candidates are not polling well. But at the Iowa State Fair, they're stars,"Holly Bailey reports from Des Moines: "Amy Klobuchar stood over the searing heat of a smoking grill to flip pork chops. ... By the time the senator from Minnesota left the fair Saturday night, she had spent nearly eight hours on the ground, smiling and shaking hands and doing all the things that White House aspirants do when they make their quadrennial pilgrimage to this playground of fried food and presidential politics. ... For Klobuchar and other Democrats stuck near the bottom of the polls in a historically large field, the Iowa State Fair offered one of the brightest spotlights of the election contest so far, outside of the debates. These hopefuls addressed some of the largest crowds of their campaigns at the soapbox and attracted outsize media attention from the nearly 800 reporters and photographers credentialed for this year's fair, far more than in any other year."
             Several candidates walking around the fair this weekend, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio haven't qualified for next month's primary debate, so their time there was precious: "On Friday, Castro walked the fairgrounds with his family, trailed by a large media contingent that captured every little moment - including when the candidate stepped in cow manure while visiting one of the livestock barns. Castro simply walked on. ... On Saturday, Gillibrand spent hours at the fair, walking the grounds with her husband and two young sons. ... She devoted most of her speech [at the fair's political soapbox] to making the case for her struggling candidacy and asking voters to donate to keep her 2020 aspirations going."
             -- Bernie Sanders is making health care his defining issue, but will it work?Sean Sullivan reports: "'You talk like 'universal health care,' 'health care for all,' what does it mean?' Sanders told reporters on a muggy Sunday afternoon at the Iowa State Fair, referencing phrases other White House hopefuls have used. Reprising a line he used in a recent debate, he said, 'As some of you may know, I wrote the damn bill. All right? I know a little bit about it.' But it's not clear if the emboldened approach will help Sanders or compound his troubles. Critics have raised concerns about ending private insurance and raising taxes to pay for the proposal. ... And voters are showing more uncertainty about Medicare-for-all at Democratic events. Another challenge, some Democrats say, is that Sanders is no longer the only major candidate supporting Medicare-for-all, potentially making him a victim of his own success."
             -- Sanders also launched a baseless attack against The Washington Post, accusing the publication of biased coverage because of his criticism of Amazon.Felicia Sonmez reports: "The Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, and operates independently of Amazon. At his town hall Monday in Wolfeboro, N.H., Sanders asked the audience, 'Anybody here know how much Amazon paid in taxes last year?' 'Nothing!' some in the crowd replied. 'See, I talk about that all of the time,' Sanders replied. 'And then I wonder why The Washington Post - which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon - doesn't write particularly good articles about me. I don't know why. But I guess maybe there's a connection. Maybe we helped raise the minimum wage at Amazon to 15 bucks an hour as well.'"
             -- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) will take a two-week leave of absence from her presidential campaign to report for active duty with the Hawaiian Army National Guard in Indonesia. "I love our country. I love being able to serve our country in so many ways including as a soldier," she said. "And so while some people are telling me, like gosh this is a terrible time to leave the campaign, can't you find a way out of it? You know that's not what this is about." (CBS News)
             -- The fear of being called "racist" is the new "cultural anxiety" for Trump supporters. Eugene Scott explains: "Fear of being accused of backing a white supremacist worldview caused many Trump fans to remain silent about their support for the real estate developer or to publicly express support for someone else while privately backing Trump. Today, on the second anniversary of the Charlottesville violence that led the president to call neo-Nazis 'very good people,' and as the president's overall approval ratings remain relatively low, many of those who brought him to the dance appear to be dancing more closely than ever. And they are blaming their critics for their faithfulness to a man whom writer Ta-Nehisi Coates called 'America's first white president.' ... Many Trump supporters express indignation at being labeled racist, but the worldview they admittedly embrace demonstrates a hostility to diversity."
             -- Politicizing the judicial branch and further eroding the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, the reelection campaigns for Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are selling "Back-to-Back Supreme Court Champs" T-shirts that include references to Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.From Felicia Sonmez: "The black T-shirt features the silhouettes of Trump and McConnell on the front and the names of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on its sleeves. It is available to supporters who make a donation of $35 or more through a joint fundraising site set up by both campaigns."
             -- Stacey Abrams is taking her voting rights crusade national by launching a voter protection program in battleground states ahead of the presidential election.Vanessa Williams reports: "The initiative, called 'Fair Fight 2020,' takes its name from the organization that the Georgia Democrat founded last year after narrowly losing her bid to become the nation's first black female governor. Abrams is set to announce the program Tuesday during a speech at the convention of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades in Las Vegas."

The Technology 202: Googlers demand company renounce working with Trump immigration agencies

             Google's challenges are mounting from within as employees call on the company to promise it won't do business with the Trump administration's immigration apparatus.           
More than 600 Googlers signed a Medium petition challenging Google executives to pledge not to do business with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Employees launched the effort as concerns are growing that Google could be in the running for a new cloud contract that CBP is seeking.
The petition slams CBP for engaging in "human rights abuses at the U.S. Southern border," and insisted that the company "would be trading its integrity for a bit of profit" if it worked with these agencies.  
 "We refuse to be complicit. It is unconscionable that Google, or any other tech company, would support agencies engaged in caging and torturing vulnerable people," the employees wrote. 
             The petition creates another dilemma for Google, which has been forced to respond in recent years to a groundswell of employee activism that is shaping the company's business decisions on everything from Pentagon contracts to its business plans in China.          
             The Trump era has sparked a Catch-22 for the company as criticism surges across the political spectrum. The search giant is trying to appease liberal employees who are increasingly taking their beef with the company's positions public, while simultaneously weathering accusations from Republicans - including the president - who say the company is politically biased against conservatives. (Google did not respond to a request for comment on the petition, but the company has repeatedly denied it is biased against conservatives.) 
Mark Egerman, a Google Maps product manager who was one of the co-authors of the petition, tells me that he doesn't believe there is any possible situation where Google will be able to appease Republican critics such as President Trump or Republican Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.).
Egerman calling on Google's leadership to prioritize morality above politics. "I am empathetic toward the leadership, I would not want the president tweeting at me," he said. "But he's going to do it anyways, so let's do the right thing."
             Yet taking a strong stance against working with the Trump administration's immigration agencies could strain an already tense relationship between Google and the Trump administration. The president has escalated his attacks on the search giant in recent months on Twitter. Earlier this month, he unleashed a series of tweets accusing the company of favoring negative news stories about him in the 2016 election, adding his administration is watching the company "very closely."
Google employees are concerned that the administration will turn to the search giant for cloud products because it is one of the top three providers of such services. Amazon and Microsoft also have significant cloud computing businesses and contracts with the government, and employees at those companies have voiced similar concerns about doing business with immigration authorities. Microsoft employees last year called on the company to cancel work with ICE, and Amazon employees wrote a letter stating they were "deeply concerned" that Amazon is providing infrastructure and services that enable ICE as well as the Department of Homeland Security. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
             The employee activism on immigration has surged beyond the tech giants. Employees at Boston-based Wayfair recently staged a walkout to protest executives' refusal to withdrawal from a contract that provided bedroom furniture to a federal detention center for migrants. The Google employees "stand with" the activists within other companies, Egerman said. Employees from Wayfair, Amazon and Microsoft also signed Google's petition. 
             The petition is just the latest sign that employee activism at Google is only picking up as employees realize their power to influence company decision-making in a competitive market for tech talent. Last year, Google employees staged a global walkout to protest the company's policy of requiring employees to settle disputes with the company through forced arbitration, which critics said silenced employees who experienced sexual harassment at the company. Google employees also protested the company's controversial plans to build a censored version of its search engine for China, known as Project Dragonfly. A Google executive recently testified that project has been "terminated." Googlers also protested a contract that the company had with the Pentagon, known as Project Maven, due to concerns Google's technology could be used to build artificial intelligence for warfare. The company decided not to renew the contract under the pressure. 
Wired's Nitasha Tiku recently documented the roller-coaster of employee activism confronting Google in this month's magazine cover story. She writes the wave of employee activism stems from the company's corporate culture: "To invent products like Gmail, Earth, and Translate, you need coddled geniuses free to let their minds run wild," she writes. "But to lock down lucrative government contracts or expand into coveted foreign markets, as Google increasingly needed to do, you need to be able to issue orders and give clients what they want."
Egerman said yesterday evening he had not heard a response from Google executives. He hopes they will back employees, as they did in the early days of the Trump administration, when thousands of employees rallied against Trump's travel ban from seven Muslim-majority countries. Google executives including chief executive Sundar Pichai and Google co-founder Sergey Brin joined the employees in voicing concerns over the order. 
"We have seen in the past two years Google employees very engaged in fighting for what they believe is right," Egerman said. "Without clarity from leadership, this is not going away."

             BITS: Leaders on the House Homeland Security Committee have issued a subpoena to compel the owner of 8chan, the anonymous website with ties to online extremism, to testify in front of Congress. The demand follows a letter Congress sent last week asking owner Jim Watkins to appear, adding greater legal weight to government scrutiny of the controversial forum, my colleague Drew Harwell reports.
"At least three acts of deadly white supremacist extremist violence have been linked to 8chan in the last six months," the committee's leaders, chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) and Rep. Mike D. Rogers (R-Ala.), said in a statement. "We have questions on what is being done to counter this trend so we can be sure it is being properly addressed."
8chan has long served as a host for online extremism, but its connection to a recent mass shooting in El Paso accelerated scrutiny of the platform. Lawmakers hosted an April hearing on white supremacy online after a shooter posted his manifesto and a live stream of an attack on a New Zealand mosque to Facebook in March, but 8chan was not included.
Watkins did not return The Post's request for comment but said in a video on Sunday that 8chan would remain down until he has spoken with lawmakers. The site has been down since Internet infrastructure firms withdrew their services last week.
             NIBBLES: Facebook wants to make its platform safer by using artificial intelligence and other tools to more proactively moderate content in private and public groups, the company announced yesterday. The updates in group safety follows growing criticism of the ways users employ hidden groups to spread hate speech and conspiracy theories with little recourse.       
          A new tool called "Group Quality" will allow administrators to see which content was removed or flagged for violating community standards - as well as highlight any false news shared in the group, vice president of engineering Tom Alison wrote in a blog. But moderation still depends on many factors, and many critics argue the tool doesn't go far enough to prevent harm.       
          "Just in the past month, I reported groups calling for a global purge of Islam, extermination of people based on religion, and calling for violence through a race war, and Facebook's response was that none of these groups was a violation of community standards," Megan Squire, a computer science professor and online extremism researcher, told NBC News' Brandy Zadrozny. Facebook declined to comment to NBC on whether the increased efforts to monitor groups had resulted in any removals, but Brandy reports that some leaders of conspiracy-driven Facebook groups are already reporting increased removals of content.       
             BYTES: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is asking the Federal Trade Commission's internal watchdog to look into whether the agency misled consumers about how much money they could receive from a $700 million settlement with Equifax,my colleague Tony Romm reports. The agency warned consumers last month that they were likely to get a lot less than the "up to $125" first advertised as a settlement offer.
"The FTC has the authority to investigate and protect the public from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including deceptive advertising," Warren wrote in a letter to the FTC's inspector general. "Unfortunately, it appears the agency itself may have misled the public about the terms of the Equifax settlement and their ability to obtain the full reimbursement to which they are entitled."
Warren claims that the FTC had conflicting information on its website that did not make it clear that the cash payment probably would be much less than the maximum $125 dollars. After high demand for the cash payout, the FTC released a blog encouraging consumers to choose free credit monitoring services instead and changed the language on its site. 
"The option to obtain reimbursement for alternative credit monitoring, as set forth originally in the class action settlement, was never intended to be a cash payout for all affected consumers," the FTC wrote in a statement to Tony.

             -- Brenton Tarrant, the suspect in the Christchurch, New Zealand, shootings sent a six-page letter from prison that has surfaced on the website 4chan following an apparent lapse in correction facility protocol, my colleague Siobhán O'Grady writes. The letter was published after the New Zealand government has gone to great lengths to stamp out extremism online following the shootings, which were broadcast on Facebook and heavily shared on social media. 
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden said the letter should not have been sent, saying Tarrant is someone "who has a very specific goal in mind in terms of sharing his propaganda so we should have been prepared for that."
"I think every New Zealander would have an expectation that this individual should not be able to share his hateful message from behind bars," she said.

Why mourning the El Paso shootings will undermine Trump's immigration rhetoric; The vibrant and intertwined community in El Paso and Ciudad Juárez shows how off-base the president's claims about immigration are.

President Trump visited El Paso on Wednesday to console victims of the mass shooting there, and he was greeted with protests about his immigration policies and tepid denunciations of white supremacy.
This is not a surprise. Few places along the shared international boundary between the United States and Mexico are as dynamic as El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. The historic isolation from other cities and their intense proximity to each other have long created fellowship and friction between the cities' residents. Now, the cities are mourning together the loss of life in the El Paso shooting, showing that death, walls and vindictive asylum policies cannot break the deep economic and cultural ties that bind these two international cities together.
The fates of these cities have been intertwined since the border split them in the 19th century, and families continue to cross daily for work, shopping and to be together. Few places are more reflective of the transnational links between the cities than the Cielo Vista Mall, where the Walmart at which the massacre took place is located.
When the mall opened in 1974, it was all but guaranteed that juarenses would visit and shop there regularly. And they did. The commercial center draws residents from West Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua and other nearby Mexican states. Tax-free weekends and back-to-school supply lists incentivize visitors and shopping trips. Increased wait-times at international crossings, paired with the region's scorching summers, lead shoppers to cross the border early or stay in El Paso for a weekend.
The flourishing of commercial activity here is rooted in history. In 1851, only three years after the end of hostilities between Mexico and the United States, a pro-free trade movement in northern Mexico emerged, threatening to establish a separate, independent republic if the federal government didn't loosen trade laws. Mexico City relented and encouraged greater trade across the border, fueling the region's dynamic economic and strong transnational ties. Over the following decades and into the 20th century, questions over trade and tariffs loomed over the region, while merchants on both sides of the border vied for the pesos and dollars of residents.
For example, the Popular Dry Goods Co. in downtown El Paso targeted Mexican people on both sides of the border by running ads in El Paso's El Continental and Juárez's El Fronterizo newspapers. Founded in 1902 by Adolph Schwartz, a Hungarian-Jewish immigrant whose retail career had begun in downtown Juárez, Popular became a border retail institution, drawing shoppers from both cities. During a presidential visit by Miguel Alemán to Juárez after World War II, the Popular displayed a picture of Mexico's first civilian president, a welcome sign and the flags of the two nations.
Ciudad Juárez attracted its fair share of El Pasoan consumers, too. The city was renowned for bootlegging and south-of-the-border adventures during Prohibition. Apocryphal stories placed Al Capone in the city's famous Kentucky Bar, rumored to be the place of origin of the margarita.
Alongside these famous border-crossings, a more mundane drum of regular exchange existed, creating a transnational tapestry of families, social clubs and businesses.
During World War II, El Paso residents trekked south to purchase rationed items and foodstuffs in higher quantities and at lower prices. The U.S. Office of Price Administration even made rationing cards available to Juárez residents. After the war, African American residents and GIs stationed at Fort Bliss frequented Juárez's central district, where they found respite from El Paso's formal and de facto segregation.
Despite the commercial and consumer exchange that enriched both places, El Paso eventually came to dominate the region economically. Hence, in the 1960s, the Mexican government invested 149 million pesos to develop the commercial infrastructure of Ciudad Juárez so that it could compete for consumers as well. The Programa Nacional Fronterizo, or PRONAF, provided the money to build the Plaza de las Américas mall, which former Juárez mayor Rene Mascareñas hoped could compete with El Paso's Bassett Place, Morningside Mall and Fox Plaza.
PRONAF produced mixed results. Although it provided Juárez merchants with retail space, getting products from central Mexico to the border proved costly. Moreover, beginning in the 1970s, the flow of pedestrian crossings between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez flipped, as more Mexicans visited El Paso than ever before. Historian Oscar Martínez has shown that by 1970 Juárez residents spent twice as much money in El Paso as they had in 1965, while El Pasoans and foreigners began to spend less in Juárez.
The disparity in wealth and power between the United States and Mexico exacerbated the imbalance between the sister cities. As El Paso came to rank among the safest cities in the United States, boasting remarkably low homicide rates prior to this week's massacre, it evaded the violence that turned Ciudad Juárez into the deadliest city in the world nearly a decade ago. Despite the tragic drug-related violence, transnational life along the border continued as juarenses resettled in El Paso, reopening restaurants and retail shops that had shuttered south-of-the-border, and El Paso's economy remained reliant on the maquiladora industry.
When gunfire broke out in this commercial center over the weekend, it sent ripples through a community that transcends the border between El Paso and Juárez. Mexico's foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, confirmed eight Mexican nationals died and as many as seven more were injured. The foreign minister called the shooting an "act of barbarism." Mexican President López Obrador also took to Twitter to offer his condolences in a video mentioning the "fraternal" relationship between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez.
In Juárez people organized a candlelight vigil at el punto, the place where Pope Francis delivered a sermon in 2016. On Sunday, during the inaugural game of Juárez's recently promoted soccer team to Mexico's top league, the stadium held a moment of silence while the team's flag flew at half-mast. The funeral home Perches from Ciudad Juárez, with locations in both cities, will offer free funeral services.
When the gunman entered this space, he may not have understood the complexity and richness of transnational borderlands, the meaning of shared retail spaces in El Paso and Ciudad Juárez and the deep connections between the sister cities. Yet this violence, which police say came at the hands of a white man who railed against a "Hispanic invasion," has crossed the border and touched the lives of many El Pasoans and juarenses who now grieve together. As their reaction to Trump's visit demonstrated, they are using their grief to make a powerful statement: divisive rhetoric and action cannot destroy places of encounter and exchange.

The Trump administration ramps up its war on legal immigration

For many years, whenever someone accused Republicans of being anti-immigrant, they would insist that they are actually pro-immigrant and that they opposed only illegal immigration. As long as people come legally, they would say, we welcome them.
So how many Republicans have raised their voices in opposition to the Trump administration's efforts not only to slash legal immigration but also to push out legal immigrants who are already here?
The administration has all but shut America's doors to refugees fleeing war, disaster and oppression. They've tried to make it impossible to seek asylum if you're coming from the south. They've allowed officials to reject green card applications for trivial paperwork reasons such as a missing blank page, without allowing applicants to fix the errors. They've proposed raising immigration filing fees, just to make things more difficult.
And now, they're following through on a proposal they first suggested not long after President Trump took office and officially unveiled last year, to use a 19th-century "public charge" principle to deny green cards and citizenship to legal immigrants who have ever used a public benefit such as Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program or food stamps. The policy goes even further:
             But the new rule stands to have its most dramatic impact on the numbers and demographics of those permitted to immigrate to the United States through a vast array of new criteria to assess whether an individual is "likely" to someday become a public charge.          
             Factors that can count against a green card applicant include having "a medical condition" that will interfere with work or school; not having enough money to cover "any reasonably foreseeable medical costs" related to such a medical condition; having "financial liabilities;" having been approved to receive a public benefit, even if the individual has not actually received the benefit; having a low credit score; the absence of private health insurance; the absence of a college degree; not having the English language skills "sufficient to enter the job market;" or having a sponsor who is "unlikely" to provide financial support.          
We might note that President Trump's grandfather Friedrich, who immigrated to America at the age of 16 with little education, money or ability to speak English, would almost certainly have been rejected under these standards. That's true of my ancestors who first came to America, and probably yours, too.
We should also note that the idea that if someone has ever used a public benefit then they won't ever become a contributing member of society is absurd. As a point of reference, in the wake of the Great Recession, food stamp use peaked at 47.6 million Americans, or almost 1 in 6. There are 60 million Americans on Medicare and 72 million on Medicaid and CHIP. That's not to mention the more than 150 million people who have employer coverage and therefore get a tax break that amounts to the government paying part of their premiums.
But many of us like to pretend that using government benefits is something other people do, which is why this rule brings together Republicans' contempt for immigrants with their contempt for anyone experiencing even temporary financial challenges. As research has shown, immigrants actually use these kinds of benefits less often than native-born citizens do. And as immigration advocates point out, this rule will force families to chose between staying together or staying in America if one member of the family is judged to be a "public charge" or likely to become one.
The anticipation of this rule being implemented is already keeping immigrants from applying for benefits that they're eligible for. If you can claim with a straight face that being less able to feed your children or more likely to go without medical care when you get sick better enables you to pull yourself up by those mythical bootstraps, you might be able to get a job in the Trump White House.
As I have argued before, Trump's efforts on immigration will fail to achieve their ultimate objective. America will continue to be a nation of immigrants, whites will continue to decline as a proportion of the population, this generation's immigration wave will be followed by others just as we saw previous waves from Asia and Europe, and the tide of change will not be reversed. America cannot be made white again, no matter how hard Trump tries.
What he and the ghouls such as Stephen Miller who translate his xenophobic and racist impulses into the specifics of policy can do, however, is cause a great deal of immediate suffering to immigrants themselves. And Trump can tell people that immigrants are both the cause of their current problems and a dire threat to everything they value, and even their very lives. He can spread his poison of hate and fear, encouraging everyone to nourish and cultivate their worst impulses.
Just like the policy of taking children from their parents' arms at the border and holding children in cages, this one is meant to have a practical impact, but it's also meant to send a message. That message is this: We hate you and we don't want you here, and if you come we will treat you with all the cruelty we can muster. If you support this president, that's what you've signed on to.

Trump's latest immigration proposal has one goal: Keep immigrants out; The proposed rule is not only economically misguided; it sets legal immigrants up to fail.

             David Bier is an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute.          
President Trump's administration rolled out its most significant change yet to immigration policy Monday: the "public charge" rule. This regulation will ban legal immigrants if government bureaucrats believe that they might use welfare. Officials claim the rule will protect taxpayers and make immigrants self-sufficient, but the rule isn't designed to meet these goals. It's just designed to keep immigrants out.
In the late 19th century, when Congress first passed the law on which the regulation relies, a "public charge" meant a ward of the state - someone whom the government had the primary responsibility to care for. These people lived in "almshouses" and were entirely dependent on the government for their subsistence. Congress rightly decided it wanted only immigrants who could support themselves or be supported by family or private charity.
As almshouses disappeared and the modern welfare state emerged, implementation of the public-charge standard fluctuated arbitrarily depending on the administration. Finally, in 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service introduced a clear definition of a public charge: anyone who receives most of their cash income from the government. This standard accounted for both the receipt of benefits but also how much the immigrants were supporting themselves.
But the Trump administration rejects this historic understanding. Its rule will ban immigrants if they might - again, in the future - use any welfare at all (including noncash programs such as Medicaid) for more than 12 months in any 36-month period. Using four different programs for three months would count as 12 months of use, making anyone who falls on hard times for even the briefest period a "public charge."
The real problem with the public charge's new definition is not that it's harsh; immigrants can certainly survive without welfare. The problem is that it's economically misguided. No one who cares about public finances would design a rule that entirely ignores the degree to which the immigrants support themselves. Mere use - projected by a bureaucrat in any amount - would trigger a public-charge denial, even if it was a tiny fraction of the person's income.
For example, a government adjudicator could estimate that that an immigrant would receive 95 percent of their income from private sources and just 5 percent from the government, yet that (projected) 5 percent would require the applicant be denied. Long gone are the days when public charges were people almost entirely dependent on the state. Now, this administration wants us to believe that people almost entirely independent from the state are public charges.
There's an irony in how the rule defines "dependency," too. At one point, it defines a dependent of an immigrant as someone who receives more than 50 percent of their financial support from that immigrant. But then, in its next breath, the rule labels a dependent of the government as anyone who receives anything - even less than 5 percent of their income - from the government.
It's contradictory, but if the goal is just to reduce legal immigration, the contradiction makes perfect sense.
The problem with the rule runs deeper. The entire methodology of how a bureaucrat will predict someone's future likelihood to use benefits is designed to set immigrants up to fail. It sets up a checklist of factors, including age, education, family size, English language ability, income, assets, etc. The government plans to count the negative factors and "weigh" them against the positive ones.
But empirically, it's just not true that a person with two "negative" factors is twice as likely to use government benefits than someone with just one factor in isolation - or any more likely at all. For example, the government plans to "negatively weight" dropping out of high school and not speaking English. But someone who both dropped out of high school and doesn't speak English is no likelier to use benefits than someone who just dropped out of high school.
This wouldn't be a big deal if these factors in isolation were good predictors of welfare use. But according to data that the government                 cites              in the rule, they aren't. Nearly 70 percent of noncitizens who don't speak English didn't use any welfare at all in 2013. This was virtually the same percentage as for high school dropouts. 
In other words, these factors aren't good at predicting welfare use, and few immigrants - just 1 in 5, according to government data - used any welfare in 2013. Still, the government plans to use these factors anyway. Adding this inaccurate and misleading methodology to an already hopelessly flawed definition will produce disaster for legal immigrants. When the rule takes effect in October, legal immigrants will receive a blitz of denials.
Barring noncitizens from welfare makes sense. But banning immigrants from the country based on an inaccurate methodology won't help public finances because most immigrants, according to the National Academy of Sciences, will pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their lives.
Far from helping to "protect taxpayers" and requiring self-sufficiency, the public-charge rule will harm the economy by turning away hard-working immigrants who are contributing to the United States. Unfortunately, the effect of the misguided policy is - for the president - a feature, not a bug.

Jose Bello was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement two days after reading a poem that was critical of the agency at a public meeting in May. The 22-year-old farmworker spent the next three months imprisoned at Mesa Verde Detention Center in Bakersfield, Calif., which forced him to put his education on hold and limited his contact with his 1-year-old son.
On Monday afternoon, Bello was freed on $50,000 bail, thanks to contributions from the New York Immigrant Freedom Fund, the National Bail Fund Network and two people he had seen on TV before - Washington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman and New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis.
"To me, it seemed like a dream," Bello said in a phone interview. "It's like something that you hear about in movies. I watch football, and I know how much attention and how famous those people are, so just the fact that they would look into helping me out, it was a great honor. I know who they are. I was shocked in a good way."
Bello, an undocumented immigrant who moved to the United States when he was 3 years old, was first arrested by ICE in May 2018. The agency said Bello was a member of a local street gang, but a federal immigration judge ordered his release in August 2018 on a $10,000 bond. Bello was charged with driving under the influence in January but not detained. He was arrested at his home in May, less than 36 hours after he recited his poem, which was critical of the Trump administration's treatment of immigrants, at a meeting of the Kern County Board of Supervisors.
The ACLU of Southern California filed a lawsuit claiming Bello's unusually large, ICE-imposed bond was retaliation for his poem and a violation of his First Amendment rights. The judge who denied the ACLU's petition on Bello's behalf argued that ICE had an "objectively reasonable legal justification" to rearrest him based on his misdemeanor DUI, but she said ICE's decision to detain him four months later and set his bond at $50,000 was "highly suggestive of retaliatory intent."
"Those three months that I was detained, I just felt like it was cruel," said Bello, who is also represented by attorneys from the United Farm Workers Foundation. "I couldn't hold my child. I would have to push him away from me or I would get in trouble. I don't think any parent should have to experience that. How do you do that to a child? I feel guilty about that, and I'm trying to make up for that time I couldn't spend with him."
Bello is free while his lawyers appeal his case. He already has talked to officials at Bakersfield College about re-enrolling and said he's two or three semesters from graduating with a business administration degree. In the meantime, he plans to continue to speak out in support of fellow immigrants.
"It's important for folks to know that there's help, how to ask for help and being able to find those resources," he said. "I'll definitely be around."
"We are fighting for a world where people can speak freely without fear or reprisal," Jordan Wells, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California said. "We would support any client, including Jose, to continue to exercise their First Amendment rights to criticize the government."
Norman and Davis are both members of the Players Coalition, an independent task force of 12 members co-founded by former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin and Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins in 2017 that is dedicated to improving social justice and racial equality. Norman and Davis visited an immigrant respite center in McAllen, Tex., to witness the crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border firsthand in June. Norman made an $18,000 donation to the center afterward.
Norman tweeted about Bello's release Tuesday. "ICE is using detention and deportation as weapons to silence immigrant activists," he wrote, in part. "... The contributions we are making help support your fight for peace and sanctuary; we will continue until that work is done!"
"I think it's only right for them to try to help bring about positive change," said Bello, who hadn't spoken to Norman or Davis as of Wednesday afternoon but looked forward to the opportunity to do so. "These are issues that affect everybody. We can only do so much on a local level. They're national, and they're very famous. I think it's the right thing to do and it's an honor just to be able to be part of that."

Trump's claim that he supports legal immigration turns out to be a lie; Cruelty is the guiding principle in the administration's treatment of nonwhite immigrants.

The erratic Trump administration has had just one consistent policy principle, one guiding North Star: punitive and often sadistic treatment of nonwhite immigrants.
President Trump's claim that he supports legal immigration, as opposed to the undocumented "invasion" he rails against, turns out to be - big surprise - a lie. On Monday, the administration proved its antagonism toward those who "stand in line" and "come in the right way" by issuing a new rule forcing many legal immigrants to make an impossible choice: accept needed government benefits to which they are fully entitled, or preserve their chances of obtaining permanent residence.
Say you're an immigrant from Mexico who came here legally to join family members who are already permanent residents or citizens. Say you're working a full-time minimum-wage job, plus odd jobs nights and weekends. You are a productive member of society. You are paying payroll taxes, sales taxes, vehicle registration fees and other government levies. Still, as hard as you work, you can't make ends meet. 
You may be legally entitled to health care through Medicaid. You may be entitled to food assistance through the SNAP program, formerly known as food stamps. You may be entitled to housing assistance. But according to the new Trump administration rule - set to take effect in two months - if you use any of these programs, you might forfeit the opportunity to ever obtain a green card making you a permanent resident. That means you also forfeit the chance of ever becoming a citizen.
Long advocated by White House adviser Stephen Miller, the Torquemada of the immigration inquisition, the new policy is a major step in Trump's crusade to Make America White Again. If it survives court challenges, the new rule could dramatically reduce legal - I repeat, legal - immigration from low-income countries. Not just coincidentally, I am sure, this means fewer black and brown people would be granted resident status.
Trump's message to the world: Keep your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. As he memorably and disgracefully put it: "Our Country is FULL!"
This is part of a well-established pattern. Trump often uses immigrants as scapegoats, encouraging his supporters to blame them for any and all problems they face. But beneath the cynical posturing there appears to be genuine animus.
Does the president hate all immigrants? He did once allegedly muse about wanting more newcomers from Norway. But those who are not white are treated, by this administration, as if they were not fully human.
How else to characterize a policy of cruelly separating children from their asylum-seeking parents at the border? Of keeping children in cages and denying them toothbrushes or soap? Of cramming adults into overcrowded lockups when their only crime was to lawfully seek refuge from violence and persecution?
Last week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement staged what was apparently the biggest one-day immigration raid in modern American history. Approximately 680 men and women classified as "removable aliens" were arrested at seven work sites in Mississippi. Taken from their job sites, many left young children waiting in vain, and in anguish, for their parents to pick them up from school or day care.
ICE has limited resources - certainly nowhere near enough to go after all the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States. The only policy that makes sense is to prioritize the capture and removal of those who pose a genuine danger, such as MS-13 gang members. But that's not who you find punching a clock for minimum wage at a chicken plant in Mississippi. Instead, you find hard-working people trying to put food on the table for their families.
The raid was a demonstration, a warning, a show of force. If the administration were serious, it would have gone after the employers, who were not immediately hit with charges or sanctions - and are already looking for replacement workers. The message to undocumented migrants was: You are weak. We can hurt you whenever we want.
Sensible immigration reform would provide the law-abiding undocumented with a pathway to legal status and citizenship. But the Republican Party blocks action because it is terrified that these immigrants would eventually become Democrats. I wonder why.
I'm betting that not a single unemployed steelworker or laid-off coal miner moves to Mississippi to take those jobs plucking poultry. Trump's immigration policy isn't a matter of economics. Nor is it a matter of principle or fairness.
Cruelty isn't a sideshow in the way Trump deals with nonwhite immigrants. It's the main event.

Washington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman and New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis helped pay the $50,000 bail for 22-year-old college student and farmworker Jose Bello, who was imprisoned at the Mesa Verde Detention Center in Bakersfield, Calif., for 89 days after reading a poem criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a public meeting in May.
The New York Immigrant Freedom Fund and the National Bail Fund Network also contributed to paying Bello's ICE-imposed bail, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which had filed a federal lawsuit on Bello's behalf. ICE arrested Bello, a student at Bakersfield College who makes about $20,000 a year, at his home two days after he recited his poem at a meeting of the Kern County Board of Supervisors. He was released Monday.
"Jose Bello was exercising a fundamental right that we pride ourselves on as Americans," Norman said in a statement shared by the ACLU. "If he was detained for reciting a peaceful poem then we should really ask ourselves, are our words truly free? This is America right? Where the 1st Amendment is freedom of speech unless I missed the memo somewhere. He was exercising that right."
Norman and Davis are both members of the Players Coalition, an independent task force of 12 members co-founded by former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin and Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins in 2017 that is dedicated to improving social justice and racial equality. Earlier this offseason, Norman and Davis delivered a U-Haul truck filled with bottled water to Flint, Mich., and visited an immigrant respite center in McAllen, Tex., to witness the crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border firsthand. Norman made an $18,000 donation to the center afterward.
             Bakersfield.com reported that ICE first arrested Bello in May 2018, claiming he was a member of a local street gang, but a federal immigration judge ordered his release last August on $10,000 bond. Bello was arrested again in January for driving under the influence but was not detained. The judge who denied the ACLU's most recent petition on Bello's behalf argued that ICE had an "objectively reasonable legal justification" to rearrest him based on his misdemeanor DUI, but she said ICE's decision to detain him four months later and set his bond at $50,000 was "highly suggestive of retaliatory intent."
"Unfortunately his story is not unique," Norman tweeted Tuesday, along with the video of Bello reciting his poem. "ICE is using detention and deportation as weapons to silence immigrant activists and I've seen this 1st hand through our work at the border with my brother [Demario Davis]. In those moments I often think to myself, Is this really the America i/WE ALL were birthed into? Where the Golden Standard Rule "IS" Liberty & Justice for all? (Or did I miss that memo somewhere [too]!?) 
"So I say To the many others out there that are pinned down by the atrocities of what's happening right now to you by our very own fellow citizens of this Great Country. Don't let these rotten apples spoil your hopes & dreams of True Freedom...they clearly do not know what they do & I'm truly deeply sorry for their actions. Just know we are watching, the Whole World is, & the contributions we are making help support your fight for peace and sanctuary; we will continue until that work is done! Psalms 22:24."
"We're always searching for a place where we can be of service, and this was one of those places," Norman told NFL.com. "Because of the indecency of what's going on with these people - not just these people, but the immigration issue overall - we felt compelled to get involved. They're fighting against a force that's almost immovable, that's attempting to silence them. So we're trying to help the ones that do have a voice so they can be heard. It's crazy that now our First Amendment right is being challenged, and we want to be on the right side of history."

Trump administration defends treatment of migrant children amid backlash to D.C. shelter; Officials awarded a contract for a 200-bed facility in the District that is opposed by immigration advocates and the mayor.

A federal agency defended itself Wednesday against backlash to a planned shelter for unaccompanied migrant children in Washington, saying it treats minors with dignity and respect.
In a statement to The Washington Post, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that it granted a $20.5 million contract in August to a contractor to operate a 200-bed facility in the District for children ages 12 to 17.
Dynamic Service Solutions, a federal contractor, applied for a permit to open a shelter, a request city officials said they found "inadequate." The permit application is still pending before the agency.
D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), several local lawmakers and immigration advocates said Tuesday that they oppose the shelter because of the Trump administration's track record for housing migrants in squalid conditions. 
Bowser said the city has "no intention" of accepting the facility, and her administration issues the licenses needed for such shelters to open.
"Washington, D.C. will not be complicit in the inhumane practice of detaining migrant children in warehouses," Bowser said in a statement. "We have no intention of accepting a new federal facility, least of all one that detains and dehumanizes migrant children."
HHS officials said migrant children in their care have their own beds and access to meals, legal services, board games, sports and classes. The Trump administration previously planned to cut some of those services, but a supplemental budget passed by Congress restored the funding.
"We treat the children in our care with dignity and respect, and deliver services to them in a compassionate and organized manner while we work expeditiously to unify each one with a suitable sponsor," the press office at the agency's Administration for Children and Families said in a statement.
"Unfortunately, uninformed individuals continue to perpetuate erroneous and irresponsible stories which only hinder our ability to run this program successfully and unify children with their parents, family member or other suitable sponsor," the statement said.
The agency's defense comes as advocates and elected officials elsewhere, including in Northern Virginia, oppose the Trump administration's efforts to establish new shelters for migrant children. 
Federal officials have reported a surge of unaccompanied minors at the border in the past year and are trying to expand their capacity to house them until they can be placed with a sponsor or relative in the United States. 
In its statement, HHS stressed that unaccompanied minors were not with a parent or a guardian when apprehended, unlike immigrant children separated from their families. 
The agency said it is responsible for more than 8,000 children across 170 facilities and programs in 23 states.
Dynamic Service Solutions, a Maryland-based federal contractor, did not return requests for comment.
Federal officials said the shelter would be called ChildrenFirst D.C. but declined to reveal the proposed shelter's location. 
City officials said it would be placed in the Takoma neighborhood in Northwest Washington near the Maryland border.
Dynamic Service Solutions has been advertising for jobs at the shelter, including for bilingual educators, case managers and medical staff. 
HHS said the shelter's total capacity depends on what District officials allow. 
D.C. Council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) is considering introducing emergency legislation to block the shelter by capping the number of youths that can be in a facility.
The D.C. Council's office Twitter account decried the planned shelter on Wednesday, tweeting that "Children are to be worshipped, not warehoused."

'It had nothing to do with us': Restrictionist groups distance themselves from accused El Paso shooter, who shared similar views on immigrants; Three Washington-based organizations have helped provide the intellectual and ideological framework for President Trump's hard-line immigration agenda. Some of their ideas were echoed by the alleged gunman.

Hours after the mass shooting in El Paso last weekend, Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, issued a tweet in the organization's name denouncing the "tragic" carnage and urging Americans to "stand together against senseless rage and destructive impulses." 
FAIR, a leading proponent of restricting immigration, typically provides its 300,000 followers on Twitter and 2.1 million on Facebook with links to studies, news stories and podcasts warning of the economic, public safety and environmental costs of high immigration levels.
But Stein made no mention in his tweet of the online document police believe was written by the alleged killer, Patrick Wood Crusius, which cited many of the same arguments against immigration as a rationale and motivation for the attack that killed 22 people in a predominantly Hispanic city near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Stein's decision to rapidly issue a statement condemning the El Paso massacre - the group did not comment on the weekend's other mass shooting, in Dayton, Ohio - reflects a sense of alarm among FAIR and the small cohort of other restrictionist groups about potential political fallout from the massacres.
Long relegated to the fringes of the debate, these organizations have moved center stage under President Trump - helping to provide the intellectual and ideological framework for the administration's hard-line immigration agenda, one that immigrant rights advocates have decried as xenophobic and racist. 
In an interview, Stein repeatedly brushed aside connections between FAIR's ideology and the suspect's, casting doubt on whether Crusius wrote the document and saying it was unfair to attribute those views as the reason for a deadly rampage.
"Any lunatic could can take paragraphs strung together from many different places and try to rationalize irrational behavior," Stein said. He suggested that the suspect was mentally ill and criticized Democrats for trying to exploit the mass shooting for political gain. 
"The fact that this alleged manifesto was picked up by people desperate for attention in the crowded Democratic [presidential] field before the blood was even cleaned off the floor tells you everything about the 2020 election," he said.
Since the El Paso shooting, Democrats have intensified their condemnation of Trump, alleging, in the words of former vice president Joe Biden, that he had "fanned the flames of white supremacy." In the weeks before the attack, Trump issued racist tweets suggesting that four minority Democratic congresswomen "go back" to foreign countries, even though they are Americans, and he disparaged Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is black, and criticized his district in Baltimore as a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."
Other mass shooters over the past two years have echoed some of Trump's language about immigrants, including a gunman at a Pittsburgh synagogue last fall who decried immigrant "invaders" at a time when Trump was warning of an "invasion" of Central Americans at the border. But the online document linked to Crusius represents perhaps the most pointed connection between anti-immigration sentiment and white nationalism. 
The statement attributed to Crusius mentioned a "Hispanic invasion" of Texas and expressed worries that the United States was in the process of a "cultural and ethnic replacement." It cited fears that immigrants would swamp taxpayers with free health care and other benefits, take over jobs and intensify the strain on environmental resources. 
The higher birthrate of migrants, the statement argued, would speed up the cultural change, and it emphasized that the writer's beliefs predated Trump's election.
FAIR, along with two other Washington-based restrictionist groups, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) and Numbers USA, have avoided linking their positions to race or ethnicity, but they have pushed similar arguments about the burden that immigrants place on all Americans, and the purported difficulties they pose to assimilation in American culture and society.
"If you have a guy who is going to be angry about immigration, have a killer offering reasons for shooting up immigrants, how could he not use reasons that have already been articulated by legitimate sources?" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of CIS, who called the online document "remarkably well-written for a 21-year-old loner." 
After the shooting, Krikorian wrote on Twitter that "it takes a special kind of evil to shoot children," and said the case appeared to be politically motivated violence that was meant as a terrorist act.
"There's only so many concerns about immigration," he said. "Of course he's going to articulate reasons that already have been spelled out in great detail by immigration skeptics. I don't know how you avoid that."
All three restrictionist groups received significant funding and foundational support from John Tanton, a Michigan doctor who professed support for eugenics, a widely debunked belief that certain beneficial human traits can be made more prominent in a population through selective breeding.
Tanton, who died last month at 85, rejected criticism that his interest in immigration was based on race and ethnicity. But according to a 2011 profile in the New York Times, he wrote to a donor that he was concerned about "the decline of folks who look like you and me," and he warned a friend that "for European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that." 
 The document attributed to Crusius referred to "The Great Replacement," a 2011 book by Renaud Camus, a French writer who promoted white-nationalist conspiracy theories that global elites were working to replace white Europeans with Muslims from Africa and the Middle East. 
The Southern Poverty Law Center has included FAIR and CIS on its list of hate groups. In January, CIS filed a federal lawsuit, saying the designation had damaged the think tank's reputation. 
"There are some extreme ideologies out there, whether on the left or right, and none of them should be acceptable, and we ought to have a civil discourse," said Ira Mehlman, a FAIR spokesman. "Our position is that everybody needs to moderate their tone."
Asked about Trump's tone, Mehlman struggled to find the right words before stating: "Look, he needs to recognize that his words and his tweets carry a lot of consequences and, like everybody else, should be used judiciously."
Stein was less circumspect, saying that "people can argue that Trump's style can be tamped down and he could be more eloquent. But nothing Trump has ever said, ever articulated, in a million years could possibly justify or be used to rationalize the behavior in El Paso."
The three groups have small staffs but outsize influence, with top officials appearing on Fox News Channel and writing opinion pieces for conservative news outlets, including Fox News and National Review.
Top Trump administration aides, including White House adviser Stephen Miller, the man behind some of the administration's most restrictive policies, have met with the groups and asked them to pass along studies and data.
Jon Feere, a former policy analyst at CIS, now serves as a senior adviser at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Julie Kirchner, who worked at FAIR for a decade, is the ombudsman at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), while two other FAIR alums, Elizabeth Jacobs, a former lobbyist, and Robert Law, who was the group's government relations director, serve as senior advisers at USCIS.
Their presence illustrates an important distinction. While the president rails most often in public about illegal immigration, the groups are focused more intently on the broader ideological project of slashing legal immigration levels, which the Trump administration has sought to do by limiting asylum seekers, refu­gee admissions and guest workers.
Feere led a study at CIS about the merits of birthright citizenship, a constitutional right that Trump has threatened to try to end through executive power. Jacobs, according to Mother Jones, advocated for ending temporary protected status for Salvadorans, reducing refu­gee numbers and defunding sanctuary cities, which are also steps Trump has pursued. 
The document attributed to Crusius did not appear to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration, blaming corporations for importing low-wage and high-skilled workers and lawmakers in both parties for allowing it.
"He did not cite our work," Krikorian said. "It had nothing to do with us."

Trump wants border-bound asylum seekers to find refuge in Guatemala instead. Guatemala isn't ready.; The small, impoverished country will be hard-pressed to meet the demands of its immigration pact with the United States.

GUATEMALA CITY - As tens of thousands of Guatemalans try to make their way to the United States every month, a much smaller group of Central Americans escaping violence and persecution have ended their journey here, seeking refuge in a country from which others are fleeing.  
Until recently, they were an aberration. That may soon change, and the prospects are not good.
Last month, the United States and Guatemala signed a "safe third country" agreement, with plans to send thousands of Central American asylum seekers to Guatemala - one of the poorest countries in the Americas. For the tiny refugee community already here, it was an absurd proposition - and one that turned their experiences into a litmus test for Guatemala's capacity as a safe haven.
Some have struggled to feed themselves as they wait for legal status. Others have endured frequent threats and watched as their neighbors were murdered or attacked.
"We arrived here more than a year ago, and we're still waiting for help. We don't have work permits. We are still waiting for the asylum people to get back to us," said Carolina Chavez, 29. She fled to Guatemala last August with her husband, Cesar Arauz, 32, and their 3-year-old son, Jourhen, after being attacked by Nicaraguan security forces for participating in an anti-government protest.
In the past year, Guatemala has received 226 asylum claims. Of those, not a single one has been processed, according to the government. The country's asylum agency has eight employees.
Between October 2018 and July, about 300,000 Salvadorans and Hondurans traveled through Guatemala on their way to the U.S. border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Even if only a small fraction of them are sent to Guatemala to apply for refuge, it would increase the number of asylum applications here by a large multiple. 
It is a challenge impoverished Guatemala is not prepared to handle, said Alejandro Giammattei, the country's newly minted president-elect. "If we do not have the capacity for our own people, just imagine other people," said Giammattei, who has been critical of the safe third country agreement.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) typically helps asylum seekers pay for their first three months of rent, but then they are left largely on their own. Without work permits - and even with them - they often fail to find jobs. That has left some homeless or only able to afford apartments in Guatemala City's most dangerous neighborhoods, known as zonas rojas, or red zones. 
 Most of the asylum seekers interviewed by The Washington Post said they felt safer here than in their native countries. Those threatening them at home had not followed them to Guatemala, they said. But finding work and shelter - and receiving formal asylum status - was so difficult that they faced a range of new threats after arriving. 
Most could think of only one solution: to leave Guatemala. In recent years, a large number of asylum seekers have abandoned their cases before they were resolved. 
For several months, after their U.N. stipend ran out, Chavez and Arauz stayed in an unfinished apartment building without a door on the edge of Guatemala City. One night, their neighbor, who was also squatting in the building, was murdered. They could hear the screams through the wall. 
The couple moved out the next morning. Eventually, they found a room they could rent for about $100 per month. To afford that expense, the family sometimes goes days without food.
 "What we see here is that asylum seekers and refugees are basically ignored. They are not given what they need to live with any kind of dignity," said Juan Luis Carbajal, who helps run the Ministry of Human Mobility, which works with UNHCR to provide for the country's pool of asylum seekers.
One of the men who came to Carbajal's organization was a Colombian man who was shot in Guatemala City - by associates of the gang he had fled back home, he claimed. Others have had to move every few months to evade threats of violence. 
When he heard about the prospect that the United States would start sending thousands of asylum seekers here, Carbajal was aghast.
"The idea that these people can find refuge here is a lie," he said. "Even with a small group of refugees, we've seen the government's inability and unwillingness to help. What happens when that number skyrockets?"
Jose Antonio Guardado, 60, was the former interim mayor of a small municipality in El Salvador called Mejicanos. He says he refused to cave to the demands of local gangs - as a politician and when he worked at a microfinance organization. The gangs responded by killing members of his family, one by one. By 2016, two of his children had been murdered and another had been kidnapped and was never seen again.
"I knew I needed to leave, but I didn't know where to go," he said. "I'd seen the stories about how dangerous it is to migrate to the United States, all the people dying in the desert. So I decided to stay here."
Since arriving here in 2017, Guardado has struggled to find a job that would help him afford food and rent. He and his son, Jahdiel, 23, who later joined him, were bombarded with threats, accused both by civilians and government officials in Guatemala of being members of MS-13, the very gang they fled.
"We're going to kill all the Salvadorans," a young man told Jahdiel when he was working the night shift last month, he said. Jahdiel works as a private security guard.
Eventually, Guardado found work selling cemetery plots. He and Jahdiel share a one-bedroom apartment on the edge of Guatemala City. Guardado writes an unpaid column for La Hora, a local newspaper, enumerating the ways in which Guatemala mistreats its tiny refugee community.
His most recent column, published Aug. 3, ran with the headline: "The Government of Guatemala Violates the Human Rights of Migrants." He addressed the safe third country deal and the promise that Guatemala would be able to handle the influx of asylum seekers.
"Migrants are not guinea pigs to be used as experiments," he wrote.
Guardado often wears his refugee identification card around his neck, ready to show proof of his legal status to anyone who asks. He has been stopped multiple times by police, he said, who told him, "That thing isn't valid here." 
The United Nations is concerned about how Guatemala's refugee agency will handle a sudden surge of new cases. 
"There is clearly a lot of work that remains to be done for Guatemala's asylum system to be able to provide full protection and inclusion for asylum seekers. The related institutions have only had to deal with a very limited number of asylum seekers to date," said Giovanni Bassu, UNHCR's regional representative for Central America. "The country has, however, made progress in a number of areas, including granting asylum seekers the right to work."
Officials at the Guatemalan asylum agency said they had not been informed about how the agency would adapt to a surge in cases. 
"We do not have details of the agreement. The authorities have not yet informed us, therefore we do not know how it would work," said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for the agency.
Acting U.S. homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan told The Post earlier this month that the agreement would be "a phased and measured approach to implementation that will not overwhelm Guatemalan resources and will be supported by U.S.-funded international organization capacity."
One 31-year-old Honduran asylum seeker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears for his safety, described how he had bounced between sleeping on floors and shelters since fleeing in 2016, after receiving death threats from a Honduran gang.  
His first landlord in Guatemala tried to sexually assault him, he said. After 14 months, he received a work permit, "but whenever I apply for a job, people look at me like, 'Oh, you're Honduran, you must be a gangster.' "
Officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have said the policy would begin with the return of single men, before single women and families are included in the plan. Privately, U.S. officials say they think that many Central Americans will choose to return home instead of applying for asylum in Guatemala.
"If the government can't make it work for 400 people, how are they going to do it for 25,000?" said Carbajal.

Four things to know about Guatemala's new president-elect; Alejandro Giammattei, a right-wing former prison director, has already said he'll try to modify the unpopular U.S.-Guatemala immigration deal in his country's favor.

Right-wing candidate Alejandro Giammattei won Guatemala's presidential election Sunday, beating former first lady Sandra Torres by a double-digit margin. Turnout was low in the runoff - a sign of voter apathy and disillusionment toward the government, experts say.
Giammattei, 63, will replace outgoing president Jimmy Morales at a time when the Central American country finds itself embroiled in corruption scandals and questions over a new immigration deal with the United States. Giammattei will take office in January.
Here's what you need to know about the president-elect:
Sunday marked Giammattei's fourth bid for Guatemala's presidency and his first victory. Each time, he has run under the banner of a different party. This cycle, he ran as the leader of the right-wing party Vamos.
Giammattei has staked out conservative positions on law enforcement and social issues, billing himself as a law-and-order candidate and a staunch opponent of same-sex marriage and abortion, according to the BBC.          
Guatemala experts said Giammattei's easy victory Sunday - he held a 16-point lead over Torres - probably reflects voter disengagement and the unpopularity of his rival rather than widespread enthusiasm about his candidacy.
Forty-two percent of registered voters cast ballots in the final race of a contentious election season in which many popular candidates were disqualified. Even though Torres won the first round, she was widely disliked among Guatemalans who perceived her to be corrupt, according to Harvard professor and Latin America historian Kirsten Weld.
"I think the fact that he was able to squeak through in this election despite having lost in his first round really owes a lot to the high abstention rate, the chaos and anarchy of this election process ... and Guatemalans' sense of really having a set of terrible options," she said of Giammattei.
Giammattei has never held political office - a fact that makes him a "bit of an unknown quantity," Weld said, despite his numerous presidential runs. Though he was trained as a doctor, he is most famous for running Guatemala's prison system.
Giammattei was appointed prisons director in 2006. While in that role, he oversaw an operation to wrest control of the Pavón prison from inmates, the BBC reported. Seven inmates were killed during security raids, and an international tribunal in Guatemala prosecuted Giammattei for his alleged involvement in extrajudicial executions. He spent 10 months in pretrial detention, according to the BBC, before he was acquitted.
Throughout his campaign, Giammattei pointed to his experience directing prisons to bolster his tough-on-crime image. The Guatemalan government has long struggled to contain the drug trafficking and gang violence that has plagued the country and spurred migration.
"Really what distinguished him as a candidate was his emphasis on cracking down on the security situation," Weld said. "For folks especially living in cities and in border regions where everyday crime is an unavoidable part of everyday life, you can see why somebody saying 'I'm going to do something about crime' would be an appealing message."
Giammattei will take office six months after Guatemala agreed to become a "safe third country" in a highly unpopular immigration deal with the Trump administration. The deal, which Morales's government signed with the Department of Homeland Security last month, would force migrants from Honduras and El Salvador hoping to seek asylum in the United States to apply for asylum in Guatemala first.
Morales agreed to the pact under pressure from President Trump, who threatened to slap tariffs on Guatemala's exports and tax remittances if Morales did not agree to his demands. In doing so, Morales bucked Guatemala's Constitutional Court, which has since issued an injunction preventing the deal's implementation.
As court proceedings continue, Giammattei may find himself dealing with a constitutional crisis provoked by his predecessor. Meanwhile, public opposition to the deal remains high. A recent poll by a Guatemalan newspaper found that 80 percent of respondents opposed the country accepting asylum seekers, according to Reuters.          
Ahead of the election, both Torres and Giammattei voiced skepticism about the asylum deal. In an interview with Reuters after his victory, Giammattei said the accord "is not right for the country." He said he hopes to seek improvements to the deal.
"I hope that during this transition the doors will open to get more information so we can see what, from a diplomatic point of view, we can do to remove from this deal the things that are not right for us, or how we can come to an agreement with the United States," he told Reuters.
U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost described Giammattei's election as a "concern" in an interview Monday on Fox News.          
"We need both Mexico and Guatemala to continue doing what they're doing," she added.
Giammattei will find himself facing pressure from all sides, according to Edward Murphy, a history professor and Latin America expert at Michigan State University.
Giammattei ran against the deal in a "nationalist response" to the Trump administration, Murphy said. But he can't risk provoking Trump's ire, he said, since Guatemala still receives aid from the United States and retaliatory sanctions would deal a blow to the economy.
Murphy said he expects Giammattei will accept the deal with a few modifications.
Giammattei has not made clear exactly how he hopes to modify the immigration deal. But he has floated a number of proposals aimed at curbing migration, promising to build an "economic wall" by creating jobs in Guatemala.
"We will focus on the construction of a different Guatemala," Giammattei said Sunday.
He also pledged during the campaign to fight corruption, although he has opposed a U.N.-backed commission that worked to prosecute elites accused of corruption and wrongdoing. That panel was the group that prosecuted - and later acquitted - Giammattei for presiding over alleged extrajudicial killings.
Corruption in Guatemala has been endemic, but judicial restructuring and a political opening that began about a decade ago appeared to be making strides toward checking it, Weld said. But she said backsliding under Morales, who ended the international anti-corruption commission's mandate earlier this year, has undone many of those gains.
Weld said Giammattei's victory "signals continuity rather than change."
"The incoming president is very much cut from the same cloth as Jimmy Morales was," she said.
Giammattei was expected to announce his cabinet Monday. He'll take office Jan. 14.

Welcome to our daily news quiz! Test your knowledge each day, Tuesday through Saturday, on the biggest and most interesting stories of the day before.
Legal immigrants seeking a green card or U.S. citizenship may have a tougher time after the Trump White House's announcement Monday of a long-expected and policy change. The widely criticized policy, called "Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds," will take effect in two months. Its aim is to limit immigrants who might draw taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare or food stamps. Immigration advocates, who say the rule change punishes people for legal benefits, expect an immediate flurry of lawsuits.
Meanwhile, the fallout of registered sex offender and millionaire Jeffrey Epstein's apparent suicide continued. Attorney General William P. Barr blasted "serious irregularities" at the New York federal detention center that held Epstein. According to sources, officers should have been checking on Epstein every 30 minutes, and he should have had a cellmate.
The Post has also been busy for months analyzing and mapping pharmacy data to track the reach of America's opioid crisis. It's the first granular look at the amount and type of pills that went through pharmacies during a period in which almost 100,000 people died of overdoses.
It was a busy news Monday in what could be a busy week. Take this five-question quiz to see if you're all caught up (for today at least).

Spanberger's and Luria's reelection will hinge on what they do about an impeachment inquiry; Forget guns, climate change, immigration, taxes, spending, education, infrastructure and everything else you thought might have been the big issue in the 2020 elections.

Forget guns, climate change, immigration, taxes, spending, education, infrastructure and everything else you thought might have been the big issue in the 2020 elections.
The only issue that matters is the impeachment inquiry underway in the House of Representatives.
You missed that huge development, the one that could bring everything official Washington does to an immediate halt?
So did a few members of the Virginia congressional delegation. They may want to start paying close attention.
Just a day before The Post published an article on the all-but-official inquiry, The Post's Jenna Portnoy reported that Rep. Gerald E. Connolly was joining fellow Northern Virginians Rep. Don Beyer and Jennifer Wexton and about 120 of their Democratic colleagues in calling for just such an investigation.
Because House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) has said formal impeachment proceedings are happening right now, we'll put Beyer, Connolly and Wexton down as "yes" votes should articles of impeachment make it to the House floor by the end of the year.
Aside from making the Iowa caucuses much more interesting, this greatly complicate the political lives and reelection prospects of two other Virginia Democrats: Reps. Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger.
The freshmen lawmakers defeated Republican incumbents in 2018 - no mean feat considering both districts are drawn to favor a Republican (Luria's 2nd District is +3 GOP, while Spanberger's 7th is +6 GOP).
It's no surprise, then, to find Luria and Spanberger on the "don't open an impeachment inquiry right now" list.
As much as both may dislike the current Oval Office occupant, the political risk of joining the impeachment parade is enormous.
So they have deflected the issue. Luria said, "If people have complaints about how we're being governed, they should get out and they should vote." 
Spanberger said she's undecided on an impeachment inquiry and prefers to spend her energy trying to "get stuff done." 
Fair enough. But the Judiciary Committee appears to have made such deflections meaningless. The impeachment inquiry is already happening. If Nadler's timetable is correct, articles of impeachment might hit the House floor before year's end.
What would Luria and Spanberger do?
The progressive base will not allow them to duck, dodge and dive on impeachment. It's yes or no.
And forget about abstaining. Heading into a presidential election year, abstention would be akin to conceding the general election (if not guaranteeing a primary challenge, first).
Maybe Reps. Don McEachin and Robert C. "Bobby" Scott could offer guidance. Neither has made a decision about an inquiry, either. 
The difference is that McEachin and Scott represent safe Democratic districts. They could support the inquiry, even vote for impeachment, and not face serious Republican opposition for doing so.
So they aren't much help to Luria and Spanberger.
What about the other big-name Democrat on the Virginia ballot in 2020: Sen. Mark R. Warner?
Warner's wafer-thin victory over Republican Ed Gillespie in 2014 demolished his presidential ambitions. But fortune, and a slot on the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections, gave Warner plenty of opportunities to become a full-throated resistance leader.
To his credit, Warner has declined to do so, just as he's decided to keep the impeachment fray at arm's length. In an interview with Wired magazine, Warner said he gets why people are upset with Trump's "activities and tweets and antics." 
But, as with Luria, Warner said he thinks the best way to fix it "is to defeat [Trump] at the ballot box in a free and fair election." 
This gives Luria and Spanberger a bit of high-level cover in the commonwealth - for now. 
But if articles of impeachment do get to the floor, neither Warner's cover nor mad deflection skills would save Luria and Spanberger from having to cast a vote that will define the 2020 election and their prospects for reelection.

The Justice Department moved Friday to potentially decertify the union that represents federal immigration judges, a spokesman said, a maneuver that could silence an organization that has been critical of some aspects of the Trump administration's overhaul of immigration enforcement. 
The department filed a petition asking the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority to examine whether it should revoke the certification of the National Association of Immigration Judges because, a Justice Department spokesman said, its members are "management officials" under the law. 
Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the association's president, said she thinks the petition's intent is to "disband and destroy the union," which has publicly pushed for judges to have more independence and sparred with the Justice Department over a quota system it imposed. 
"It's designed to take full control of judges without having a balancing force or a balancing voice," Tabaddor said.
Immigration judges, who decide deportation and other-immigration related cases, are somewhat unusual in that they are not part of the judicial branch; rather, they are Justice Department employees. Like other Justice Department employees, they are generally prohibited from talking publicly - except that their union can advocate for them.
Tabaddor, for example, was skeptical last year of the administration's effort to pressure judges to process cases faster by implementing a quota system tied to their performance reviews, saying the directive "could call into question the integrity and impartiality of the court if a judge's decision is influenced by factors outside the facts of the case." The union has also advocated for judges to be independent of the attorney general. 
Tabaddor disputed that immigration judges could be considered management and thus not eligible to unionize. 
"We don't even have the authority to order the procurement of pencils," she said. 
The Justice Department's filing will spark the opening of a case, and attorneys with the Federal Labor Relations Authority will probably then conduct an investigation, a Justice Department spokesman said, and the timing of the process varies significantly from case to case.

Trump's ultimate immigration failure; He can't stop immigrants from coming, and he can't stop the United States from changing.

There is no policy issue about which President Trump cares more than immigration. Indeed, other than trade, it's pretty much the only policy issue he cares about at all. For all the controversy that has attended the president's racist statements and cruel policy changes, one fundamental truth has gone nearly unnoticed: By any measure you could think of, on immigration, Trump has been a complete and utter failure.
That's true of both the specific actions he has taken and of the broad, long-term goals he is trying to achieve - goals that were never possible in the first place.
Let's start with the particular. A month ago, the administration announced it would soon begin a nationwide sweep of undocumented immigrants, and Trump said "millions" of people would be rounded up. The actual number of arrests in this high-profile operation turned out to be 35. On Wednesday, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement launched raids on seven agricultural processing plants in Mississippi, arresting 680 people.
Despite the attention the administration has called to raids like that one, and the policy of family separation that was intended in its cruelty to create a deterrent to immigration, people keep coming. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it apprehended more than 780,000 people along the southern border in the first nine months of the fiscal year beginning last October. That's compared to 521,000 in all of fiscal 2018, and 415,000 in fiscal 2017. So despite all of Trump's efforts, more people are coming to the United States - particularly from Central America. He has failed. And he has also failed to build the "big, beautiful wall" that, during the 2016 campaign, he promised would stretch from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.
The parts of his immigration agenda that Trump has implemented with any degree of success are in practical terms the least important to his overall vision. For instance, he has all but shut America's doors to refugees, but refugees make up only a tiny portion of the immigrant population. The highest number of refugees admitted in recent years was in fiscal 2016, when 85,000 came to the United States, essentially a rounding error when placed alongside the 40 million foreign-born people living here today.
That latter number is what Trump supporters and Trump himself really have a problem with. What they have always been after isn't just a reorientation of immigration policy away from being welcoming and toward being restrictive. They want a transformation of American society itself. The grievances to which Trump appealed in 2016 - and which he thinks will win him reelection - are about certain people's feeling of disorientation in the face of a changing society, where native-born white people are seeing immigrants in places they didn't before, or fearing that immigrants will come to their communities even if they haven't yet.
Trump has now been president for nearly three years, and his supporters should ask themselves: How's it working out? Trump spun out a fantasy when he ran in 2016 and has continued to do so as president. It's one in which his wall would end all unauthorized immigration, he'd round up all the undocumented people and send them away, and the doors of America would largely be shut, at least to nonwhite immigrants ("Why do we want these people from all these shithole countries here? We should have more people from places like Norway.")
The result - and this is the part that was unspoken but still clear - would then be a society that was "Great Again," a society where you wouldn't have to hear people speaking Spanish and where there was no doubt who was in charge.
The fact that he cannot bring that vision to reality is Trump's ultimate failure to his supporters. Even if he could somehow succeed in stopping every last immigrant from coming to the United States for the remainder of his term - which, of course, he won't - it wouldn't change the reality he wants to reverse. America is and will continue to be a diverse society. White people will continue to decline as a proportion of the population. The future will see new waves of immigrants, bringing with them their language and food and music and culture, all of which will become part of America. Our society will continue to change, because that's what it has always done. And there's nothing President Trump or his voters can do about it.

ICE Air: Shackled deportees, air freshener and cheers. America's one-way trip out.; The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement escorted a planeload of Guatemalans out of the United States. He hopes there will be many more flights just like it.

GUATEMALA CITY - About 45 minutes before descent, the guards went up and down the aisle unshackling the passengers, and the mood in the cabin began to lighten. A mother with a boy near the front was still crying, but they were the only family aboard the flight. Nearly all the other 93 deportees were men, and they began joking and talking excitedly. 
Soon Guatemalan territory appeared below, misty and green. A cheer rose.
"You see? They're smiling!" said Matt Albence, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who spends a great deal of time defending his agency's core functions, including this: a one-way trip out of the United States on ICE Air. "This is probably better than some of the commercial flights I fly on."
It was Albence's first visit to Guatemala, the country that has surpassed Mexico as the largest source of unauthorized migration to the United States. ICE Air, the agency's charter airline, was bringing two planeloads of people to Guatemala on Thursday. The Trump administration has big plans to increase that.
President Trump has pledged to expel "millions" of immigration violators, a goal that wildly exceeds the government's abilities and the seating capacity of its aging 737s. The reality is that Trump is losing on the ground: Since the start of the 2019 fiscal year in October, ICE has deported about 50,000 Guatemalans, but nearly five times as many illegally crossed the border into the United States during that time, leading to a record influx of families and children.
In its efforts to deter Central American migrants, the Trump administration reached an accord with the Guatemalan government last month that will allow the United States to begin sending planeloads of Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers here, in addition to Guatemalan deportees. The country has a presidential runoff vote Sunday, and both candidates have criticized the deal, which will require approval by Guatemala's congress. Trump has threatened to wreck the struggling nation's economy with tariffs and taxes if he is not appeased.
ICE sends about nine flights per week to Guatemala. Its government has agreed to accept up to 20, with 135 passengers each, potentially turning the country into a kind of reverse Ellis Island - a repository, far from the U.S. border, for those the United States has rejected.
Albence, a longtime ICE official, said he wanted to see the process firsthand, and he had never been to Central America's Northern Triangle region. The day before, ICE had raided seven poultry and food plants in Mississippi, arresting 680 workers, the agency's largest workplace sting in more than a decade. Nearly 400 of those arrested are from Guatemala.
Despite the scenes of anguished children without their parents in Mississippi, Albence called it a "textbook operation." No one was injured, and nothing had leaked out in advance. Authorities said many families were reunited once parents were processed and issued court summonses. But some children were left alone, and ICE did not coordinate with state and local child-welfare providers.
"Our job is to enforce the law," said Albence, who is popular at the White House and within his agency for his tough-cop demeanor and uncomplicated, unsentimental view of the job. "It's up to Congress to make the laws or change the laws."
The flight to Guatemala originated at an airfield in Alexandria, a sleepy city in central Louisiana along the Red River. It is one of ICE Air's five deportation hubs, along with Miami; San Antonio; Brownsville, Tex.; and Mesa, Ariz. 
ICE has a "staging facility" at the Alexandria airfield where the deportees can be held for up to 72 hours after they are transferred from detention centers along the East Coast. About half the passengers on Albence's flight had criminal convictions, ICE officials said, but the agency provided The Washington Post with specific information for just a fraction of those passengers. 
Their offenses included drug dealing, assault and aggravated sexual battery of a child, according to ICE records. One had been arrested for "trespassing, loitering and prowling at night." 
Some had been in U.S. jails and prisons for months or years, and for them, the flight to Guatemala was a relief, promising freedom.
The deportees shuffled to the airplane in single file along the tarmac. Private contractors and ICE staff removed their leg restraints at the jet stairway, patting down their pockets as they boarded. Many of the men appeared to be dressed in the same clothes they were wearing when they were arrested.
A Post reporter and a Univision camera crew were allowed aboard as well, though the journalists were prohibited from speaking to the detainees during the flight. Albence and senior ICE officials also boarded, along with about a dozen guards, all unarmed. 
The Boeing 737-300 was older but clean. When the cabin door closed, a sugary, cloying scent wafted through.
"Crème brûlée," a female guard said. "The gals like to spray air freshener."
Many of the passengers were stoic and subdued, their handcuffs clinking softly in their laps. It was the first time on an airplane for some. In fewer than three hours, the southbound flight erased a journey that had taken them weeks or months, often ending in a risky trek through the desert to remote areas of the U.S.-Mexico border. To return to spouses and U.S. citizen children and their lives in the United States, they would have to do it again. 
A few on the plane were visibly excited, eager to see parents, children and siblings they had left behind years earlier. And when the aircraft dropped through the clouds and screeched to a halt on the runway, the cabin filled with clapping and cheers.
"We'll all be back there in a month," one deportee remarked in English as he and others crossed the airfield and filed into the Guatemalan government's "Reception and Repatriation Center." Financed with U.S. assistance, it is a dim, noisy arrival terminal with rows of seats and check-in booths staffed by clerks calling out passengers from the manifest. 
Albence thought it looked no worse "than a DMV."
Bouncy Guatemalan marimba music echoed in the hall. Patricia Marroquín, the first lady of Guatemala, was there to greet Albence and the deportees.
This was not unusual: Homeland Security officials have repeatedly sought out the attendance of Central America's first ladies at such events with deportees, both to highlight the returnees' welcoming treatment and to ensure local television stations broadcast footage of deportees being sent back. In June, Marroquín visited U.S. Border Patrol facilities in Texas with U.S. officials, signaling a more regional approach to the migration crisis. 
A Guatemalan official gave the deportees - now "returnees" - a stirring greeting.
"You're the lucky ones," he told them, reminding the group that so many of their compatriots had perished during the journey to the United States. "You're back home with the loved ones who you left here to support," he said. "This country is and will always be your home."
Luis de Leon, 28, wanted no part of it. He was still wearing the paint-streaked work clothes he had on when he was arrested during a traffic stop in Bowling Green, Ky. 
He had been in the United States for seven years, dodging deportation. After a 2016 DUI, he said, he quit drinking. His wife and U.S.-born children, ages 2 and 4 months, were still in Kentucky.
"There is nothing for me here," he said. "The only choice I have is to go back."
Guatemalan officials offer the returnees bus tickets to their hometowns, as well as employment assistance and temporary shelter for those who no longer have relatives who can take them in. But most of the deportees completed a quick intake process and raced for the gates. An alleyway clogged with construction debris led to a metal door that opened to a throng of people pressed into a muddy lot between the street and the center's outer wall.  
Money-changers jostled with family members awaiting long-lost relatives, offering to change U.S. dollars into Guatemalan quetzals, calling, "Pesos, pesos, pesos."
Stephanie Barrios, 28, stood there in the scrum, under a golf umbrella, waiting for her husband. Two years earlier, she had been deported from the United States, returning to a country she left as a toddler. In Los Angeles, where she grew up, she was in and out of juvenile detention and struggled with drug use. Now she works at a call center, making $700 a month. "I hate it," Barrios said in unaccented English. 
A daughter, 8, is back in Los Angeles, with Barrios's mother. Raising the child through FaceTime is awful, she said. 
"I understand where Trump is coming from, but I don't think it's fair that a lot of people are separated from their families without having done anything to deserve it," Barrios said. "Especially the children." 
Barrios does not think her husband - who runs his own auto repair shop in California - would want to remain in Guatemala. "We're planning to stay a little while, but then we'll go back," she said.
Rain began falling, and Mixzer Ruiz, 28, ducked beneath an awning and opened a sack containing his few American possessions, relacing the sneakers he was wearing when police arrested him two months earlier. He had been working as a chef at a French cafe in Alexandria, Va., he said. His neighbors summoned the police during a fight with his girlfriend, he said, and suddenly he was back in a country he left a decade earlier.
"I feel great," he said, in English. "I have my daughter here. I left when she was 2 years old."
"I just want to see her, take some trips, celebrate my daughter's birthday," Ruiz said. "Then we'll see."
Asked later about Ruiz's deportation, ICE officials said records show he was convicted in June of "felony aggravated sexual battery of a minor under 13 years." Alexandria court records show he was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a child by a custodian and was sentenced June 13. He was ordered deported last month by an immigration judge.
Albence, like many Homeland Security officials, views immigration enforcement through the lens of "consequence delivery." If migrants who cross illegally are released directly into the United States, more will come. If deportations are swift and certain, fewer will try.
For ICE, the flights have a psychological value that exceeds their seating capacity. They are a flying advertisement for U.S. enforcement, countering the sales pitch of coyote smuggling guides who promise a successful trip north.
"This is about stopping the flow before it gets to the border," Albence said before he continued on to El Salvador. "If an individual thinks they will be removed, they will think twice about spending their life savings and taking that dangerous journey."

The Mississippi raids won't solve the immigration crisis

Regarding the Aug. 9 front-page article "Officials defend ICE raids that seized parents":
Will this raid on immigrant workers solve the immigration crisis, or was it just another headline-grabbing stunt that dramatically affects the lives and families of those arrested? It was just plain mean.
The nasty little secret is that we need their cheap labor for any number of jobs. The employers benefit in many ways, as do the immigrants. The employers are breaking the law with impunity.
To halt the flow of immigrants, enforce the law. If they are hired illegally, fine the employer. Come up with a system whereby both workers and employers are accountable. Return this country to a rule of law that is both fair and equitable for all. It really can't be that hard.
Meanwhile, tone down the rhetoric and have a reasoned discussion on how this problem might best be solved for the benefit of all.

Earlier this week, the government conducted raids on agricultural processing facilities in Mississippi, arresting hundreds of undocumented workers. What you didn't see, however, was the owners of those plants being led out in handcuffs, despite the fact that they almost certainly knew whom they were employing.
That is good news for President Trump, because if we lived in a country where the people who hire undocumented workers face a serious threat of prosecution, he'd be in big trouble. The Post's Joshua Partlow and David A. Fahrenthold report:
             For nearly two decades, the Trump Organization has relied on a roving crew of Latin American employees to build fountains and waterfalls, sidewalks and rock walls at the company's winery and its golf courses from New York to Florida.          
             Other employees at Trump clubs were so impressed by the laborers - who did strenuous work with heavy stone - that they nicknamed them "Los Picapiedras," Spanish for "the Flintstones."          
             For years, their ranks have included workers who entered the United States illegally, according to two former members of the crew. Another employee, still with the company, said that remains true today.          
             President Trump "doesn't want undocumented people in the country," said one worker, Jorge Castro, a 55-year-old immigrant from Ecuador without legal status who left the company in April after nine years. "But at his properties, he still has them."          
Partlow and Fahrenthold have identified at least eight Trump properties that employed undocumented workers, and interviewed dozens of them. As one said, "If you're a good worker, papers don't matter."
And it's not like this is some kind of anomaly. Trump has been employing undocumented workers for his entire career. Some of the people who built Trump Tower four decades ago later sued him, recounting "nightmare memories of backbreaking 12-hour shifts and of being cheated with 200 other undocumented Polish immigrants out of meager wages and fringe benefits." According to this investigation, his modeling agency, Trump Model Management, brought in foreign models without working papers, instructed them to lie to customs officials about what they were doing in the United States, and kept them in squalid conditions while withholding most of their pay.
And there's one other contradiction: At Mar-a-Lago, Trump hires foreign cooks, wait staff and housekeepers, claiming he can't find Americans who'll do the work. At least that is legal. But the basic fact remains: Trump tells his supporters that undocumented immigrants represent an "invasion" of murderous outsiders who must be stopped at all costs, yet once they get here he hires them to work for him. Which of course means that he's part of the reason that they come in the first place.
It's a bit strange that Democrats don't talk about this more often, especially given that a big part of the reason Trump got elected in 2016 was his argument that the American system is "rigged" against the interests of ordinary people. It was a powerful argument because it was true. Millions of voters who felt at the mercy of corporations and a government they believe didn't care about them but instead functioned for the benefit of the wealthy and powerful nodded along in agreement when Trump said it.
The best counter-argument Democrats could offer isn't that Trump is wrong and the system isn't rigged, because it plainly is. The best counter-argument is that Trump himself is the one doing the rigging, cutting taxes for the wealthy and slashing regulations for corporations while he dodges his own taxes and employs undocumented workers.
You may have noticed that when Trump talks about the threat of immigration, he doesn't usually focus his argument on "They're taking Americans' jobs." Perhaps that's because he wants to argue that we are now living in a paradise of limitless prosperity, or perhaps it's because he realizes that in most cases - even if he could certainly find legal residents who would work at Mar-a-Lago - undocumented immigrants are doing difficult, dangerous, low-paying jobs Americans don't want. Which means that if you want people to hate and fear them, you have to make an argument based on prejudice and cultural resentment, not one based on economics.
You aren't going to see Mississippians lining up to get those jobs slaughtering chickens, when they could make just as much working at, say, Walmart and not have to worry about getting repetitive stress injuries and slicing their fingers off. And as Angela Stuesse explains, what happened this week shines a light on one more way the system is rigged against ordinary people so that very rich people can get even richer:
             The prominence of Latinos in Mississippi's chicken plants and communities today was not accidental. It was calculated, strategic and intimately related to deeply rooted structures of labor exploitation in the region. Beginning in the 1990s, Latin American immigrants were recruited to the state by the poultry industry, where they arrived to work in some of the lowest-paid and most dangerous jobs in the country.          
Once you understand that, the problem begins to look like it's not about dangerous foreigners sneaking into the country with murder on their minds, but about wealthy business owners wanting workers they can exploit even more. And that's the last thing Trump wants people to think about.

ICE agents raid Miss. work sites, arrest 680 people in largest single-state immigration enforcement action in U.S. history; The wave of arrests in six cities were the result of year-long criminal investigations.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept through seven work sites in six cities across Mississippi on Wednesday, arresting approximately 680 people the agency said were undocumented immigrants in what officials said is the largest single-state workplace enforcement action in U.S. history.
The raids targeted agricultural processing plants, part of a year-long investigation into illegal employment of immigrants in the state, officials said. They did not say how many individuals they were targeting in the operations, nor what proportion of those taken into custody were what ICE calls "collateral" arrests - those who were swept up along with those ICE was seeking.
ICE acting director Matthew Albence said at a news conference in Jackson, Miss., that some of those arrested will be prosecuted for crimes, others will be swiftly deported, and some will be released pending immigration court hearings. Albence said the raids were part of normal ICE operations that seek to enforce U.S. immigration laws.
The Trump administration has been openly stepping up pressure on the nearly 11 million immigrants believed to be in the United States illegally, threatening mass arrests of families who have arrived recently as part of an effort to deter migrants from coming to the country. The administration also has sought to turn away asylum seekers - forcing some to await their court hearings in Mexico - and now plans to deport some Central Americans to Guatemala to seek asylum there instead as part of an international agreement.
Although President Trump telegraphed the family raids several times, they have not gone forward in full force. But ICE has continued operations that it says primarily target immigrants with criminal convictions as well as those who have been deemed deportable in U.S. courts. The Mississippi raids were a stark reminder that the administration is continuing to press on immigration, with some of its largest enforcement efforts to date.
"The arrests today were the result of a year-long criminal investigation, and the arrests and warrants executed today were just another step in that investigation," Albence said Wednesday. 
ICE Homeland Security Investigations conducted the operation in partnership with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi. ICE said such enforcement efforts are focused both on those who are seeking to work unlawfully in the United States and the employers who knowingly hire them.
"To those who use illegal aliens for a competitive advantage or to make a quick buck, we have something to say to you: If we find you have violated federal criminal law, we are coming for you," said Mike Hurst, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi. But he declined to comment on whether anyone other than the immigrant workers would be charged as a result of the operation, which he said is ongoing.
Alabama-based Peco Farms Inc. confirmed in a statement that ICE raided three of its poultry processing plants in Mississippi, and the company said it is cooperating fully with federal authorities.
ICE routinely declines to provide details about individuals in its custody, but the number of those without known criminal histories out of those arrested in recent operations suggests a substantial proportion of "collaterals" during such raids.
A July analysis of ICE data by the American Immigration Council shows that ICE has cast a wider net in its arrest raids under the Trump administration than previously "in its search for individuals who may be deportable from the United States." 
Department of Homeland Security officials, emphasizing the severity of a mass influx of migrants at the Mexican border, have said repeatedly in recent months that ICE detention facilities are at capacity, forcing a backlog of detained immigrants at Border Patrol stations that are ill-equipped to hold people for long periods of time. A July report by the DHS Office of the Inspector General described ICE detention centers as "operating at or above capacity."
"During the week of our visits, ICE had approximately 54,000 beds occupied nationwide, but was only funded for 42,000 beds," the OIG report said. "In our discussions with ICE field management about this situation, they explained that their capacity to find additional bed space is strained."
Congress in June approved a $4.6 billion emergency border aid package, and nearly $209 million was designated for ICE. 
Speaking before a House Oversight Committee hearing in late July, Albence said the border crisis continues to strain resources, and he asked for more funding, saying that ICE capacity limits mean there is still a massive backlog in Border Patrol stations.
"ICE is currently detaining over 53,000 single adults, and there are approximately 8,000 single adults in CBP custody awaiting processing or transfer to ICE," Albence told members of Congress.
The raids in Mississippi came just days after a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso after reportedly driving across Texas with the intention of attacking immigrants near the U.S. border, an event that has struck fear into many Hispanic residents across the country. Coupled with Trump supporters chanting about sending minorities back to their countries and the president's own references to an immigrant "invasion," immigrant communities from coast to coast have been put on edge.
Officials said the Mississippi operation, which they said involved the mobilization of nearly 650 federal agents from across the country, was the result of a long-standing investigation that had no ties to current events. Albence said the shooting in El Paso was "horrific," but he said the raid operation had been planned long beforehand, "and we intended to carry it out."
A reporter at the news conference pointed out that the poultry farms seemed likely to have been employing illegal labor for years and asked: "Why now? . . . Do you feel like you're being directed by President Trump to do this?"
"I feel like I've been directed to enforce the law," Hurst responded.

Alex Kack couldn't believe what he was seeing.
He was sitting front row at the Tucson City Council meeting Tuesday night when the scene began unfolding next to him. As a woman in a "Make America Great Again" hat shouted for stricter enforcement of immigration laws, Kack's eyebrows arched. When she stood up, an incredulous smile spread across his mustachioed face. Then she pulled out her sign, and Kack lost it.
For the next 30 seconds, his body shook with laughter.
"It kind of just happened, and it was so absurd," Kack said in an interview with The Washington Post.
And there, in a city hall in southern Arizona, a perfect parable of modern American politics played out. It had everything: the divisive issue of sanctuary city laws; the shouting, red-capped conservatives clamoring for deportation; the roaring, slightly profane response from liberals; and Kack's what-else-can-you-do-but-laugh howling.
All that, caught on video and posted online by a local television reporter, swirled together with a little Internet je ne sais quoi on Wednesday and birthed a sensation so viral that by that evening footage of the encounter had been viewed nearly 5 million times, and Kack netted more than 20,000 new Twitter followers. He is now known as #GreenShirtGuy, because of the lime green polo he was wearing that is, he conceded, "more famous than I am."
As the woman and her male companion, reportedly members of an anti-immigrant group, continued shouting and holding signs that read in part, "Stop rewarding, start deporting," those seated around them got up and left the room. But Kack stayed in his chair, cracking up the whole time, as police officers escorted the two out of the meeting.
"I wanted to see how it ended," he said. "The police were coming, they were screaming, people were screaming back at them. How are you going to miss out on that level of political theater?"
His long chuckle won him scores of celebrity shout-outs, including Chrissy Teigen ("our heroes are not big politicians. they are people who yell or literally laugh in the faces of insanity"), Patton Oswalt ("I truly, truly, truly love you #GreenShirtGuy") and Kathy Griffin ("Um, YES, we needed this").
Kack was still audibly bewildered at his sudden social media stardom on Wednesday night - "I'm not even sure how to describe it," he said. "Pull out a thesaurus and find a word" - but he is a longtime activist and self-styled progressive.
The 28-year-old is a field organizer with the People's Defense Initiative, a Tucson-based advocacy organization pushing for an amendment to city code that would prohibit local police from cooperating with federal authorities to enforce national immigration laws. It was the group's legislation in front of the city council on Tuesday.
"It's a historic moment," Kack said of the effort. "The movement in this nation to protect migrants and refugees has a long history in Tucson. This is absolutely the time for us to put in place a law that enshrines those values."
Others at the meeting showed support for the initiative in other, similarly unique, ways. Two women stood at microphones and serenaded attendees with a protest duet about sanctuary cities, accompanied by stomps and claps. Before them, a man, channeling Pete Seeger, strummed his banjo and sang a tune of his own. He's since been dubbed "#BanjoGuy."
Kack said he believes the protection of migrants and their families is a moral imperative, one of the few clear-cut examples in American law. Anyone who would oppose that, especially so vehemently, deserves to be a laughingstock, he said.
"You come into this formal public setting like that, you take time out of your day to travel here, show up and yell racial obscenities," Kack said. "For what end? For what purpose?"
"I think the laughter struck a nerve on Twitter because that's how a lot of the country feels about it," he continued. "Philosophically, I don't even know what the best way is to meet and challenge this. The ideology is obviously dangerous, but it's inherently silly. I mean, good God, get a different hobby."
Kack has been politically active since George W. Bush's presidency: "It wasn't a great time - recession, war, take your pick." When he was younger, he said, he was probably more "radical," more into direct action.
But even then, he said, he still sometimes found himself voting for members of both major parties, and some minor ones, in local elections. Since President Trump took office, though, that occasional bipartisanship has ended.
Now, he said, the country is so polarized all you can do sometimes is joke about it. And he does that, too, during his side hustle as a stand-up comedian, playing mostly local gigs.
But for a man famous for his laughter, Kack can strike a somber note - especially when discussing the rights of migrants, refugees and the undocumented. It pains him, he said, that immigration policies force some people to worry about being separated from their families, about a routine interaction with the government leading to a deported parent or child: "It's immoral."
"Well," he said, as the interview concluded, "that got a little more heavy than you thought the 'Green Shirt Guy' would get, didn't it?"

Federal judges received a link to an anti-Semitic blog post. It came from the Justice Department.

The morning briefings come nearly every workday, seemingly chock-full of all the news fit to be seen by employees at the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which handles the country's immigration cases. Regularly topping two dozen pages, the memos include summaries of articles from outlets national and local, covering topics like "Legal News," "Enforcement News" and "Police and Legislative News."
But on Monday, tucked between stories from The Washington Post and a public radio station, the briefing included a summary of and a link to a blog post from what the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a "Hate Group": Vdare.com, a frequent platform for white nationalists espousing anti-Semitic and anti-immigration rhetoric.
The Vdare post singles out immigration judges by name, uses their photos and refers to them with an anti-Semitic slur. The Justice Department sends the briefings to all EOIR employees, including its 400-some immigration judges, which means the judges named and pictured in the derogatory post also received the link to it this week - from their employer.
The briefing was circulated the same week as President Trump faced accusations of anti-Semitism for asserting that Jewish people who vote for Democrats show "great disloyalty" and for praising Henry Ford, a virulent anti-Semite. It also comes as the Justice Department moves to possibly decertify the union that represents federal immigration judges, which could silence a group critical of some of the administration's immigration policies.
The union, the National Association of Immigration Judges, lambasted the briefing in a letter to EOIR Director James McHenry. Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the group's president and one of the judges highlighted in the post, wrote that the union had received numerous complaints from judges across the country.
"The post features links and content that directly attacks sitting Immigration Judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs and the label 'Kritarch,' " Tabaddor said in the letter, which The Post obtained.
When used with a negative tone, the reference to kritarchy, a biblical term for a system of rule by judges in ancient Israel, is "deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic," she wrote. "VDare's use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control."
An EOIR spokeswoman said the blog post, which BuzzFeed News first reported on, "should not have been included."
"The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms," the office's assistant press secretary Kathryn Mattingly told The Post.
She said the briefings are compiled by a contractor, but she did not respond to a question about whether the person responsible would be reprimanded.
Tabaddor asked EOIR to "issue an apology to all EOIR employees, particularly the impacted Immigration Judges." As of Thursday evening, Tabaddor had not received a formal apology, she told The Post.
The union also called for "immediate steps to ensure that such posts or content is not enshrined as a legitimate news source in future EOIR publications."
Monday was far from the first time the office's daily briefing has included questionable content, said immigration attorney Matthew Hoppock, who writes about the EOIR and has researched the office's morning newsletter.
In April, Hoppock published every EOIR briefing since September 2018, which he received after submitting Freedom of Information Act requests. He said he was appalled at how many stories from right-wing websites the Daily Caller and Breitbart News were included.
"The substance is really gross," Hoppock said in an interview. "Sometimes they link to The Washington Post or BuzzFeed, but a lot of times it's just nonsense. It feels like propaganda. It feels like they're being given an agenda, when they're supposed to be neutral."
Another item that stood out to him was a link to a Fox News interview with Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who led Trump's short-lived election integrity commission. The piece was titled, "Migrants have no basis to claim asylum."
"Why would you send that to immigration judges whose job it is to adjudicate asylum claims?" Hoppock said.
Hoppock criticized the department for spending money on the briefings, which are compiled by the contractor TechMIS. Steven Mains, the firm's chief executive, said the newsletters are compiled based on a set of government-approved keywords and is then sent to the Justice Department for approval before it's distributed.
"We make no editorial judgments based on viewpoints, but present the customer with all the news that fits their criteria," Mains said.
He said the Justice Department has asked the company to omit Vdare content from all future briefings. Hoppock said any claims that the inclusion of far-right material was an innocent mistake are dubious.
"It's not like they weren't aware," Hoppock said, citing a July report, published by the Young Turks, about the office's distribution of Breitbart articles. "If it is a random Google scrape and they're picking up white supremacist stuff, they should've stopped by now."
In her letter, Tabaddor said that the union supports the First Amendment and the right to free expression but that "the Department of Justice's use of its authority to legitimize and provide an imprimatur of respectability to this website under the guise of 'news' runs counter to American ideals of equality under the law."

Innocent man spent months in jail for bringing honey back to United States

Leon Haughton likes honey in his tea. Which is why during his Christmas visit to relatives in Jamaica, he made his regular stop and bought three bottles from a favorite roadside stand before heading home to Maryland.
It was a routine purchase for him until he landed at the airport in Baltimore. Customs officers detained Haughton and police arrested him, accusing him of smuggling in not honey, but liquid meth.
Haughton spent nearly three months in jail before all charges were dropped and two rounds of law enforcement lab tests showed no controlled substances in the bottles.
By then, Haughton, who according to his lawyer had no criminal record, had lost both of his jobs as a cleaner and a construction worker.
"They messed up my life," Haughton said. "I want the world to know that the system is not right. If I didn't have strong people around me, they would probably leave me in jail. You're lost in the system."
Months after his release, he is only now fully rebuilding his life after the setback devastated him and his family of six children.
Haughton's status as a legal permanent resident with a green card complicated his case. Because he was arrested at an airport for alleged drug felonies, his case triggered a federal detention order that extended his time in jail, court testimony shows.
Twenty days after his arrest, a state police lab test looking for drugs in the bottles came up negative. Yet the 45-year-old father sat behind bars for two more months total before the last of the charges were dropped after a second all-clear in a federal lab test.
"Someone dropped the ball somewhere," Haughton's lawyer Terry Morris said. "An innocent man spent 82 days in jail for bringing honey into the United States."
After landing at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on Dec. 29 around 10 p.m., U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained Haughton for more than two hours before Maryland Transportation Authority Police put him in handcuffs, according to charging documents. The bottles with gold-colored screw tops labeled "honey" in his bag, they told him, had tested positive in a drug field test for methamphetamine.
Haughton fainted. Police took him to a hospital. Then they took him to jail.
Every year for the nearly 10 years since Haughton has been living in Prince George's County, the native of Jamaica travels to the island in December to visit his mother. The green card holder never had any problem returning to Maryland until last year, when a K-9 unit started sniffing around his bag.
Haughton thought the dog was interested in his leftover chicken. But Haughton said he quickly noticed agents and officers whispering to one another before disappearing behind a screen. When they returned, a man took Haughton away. His bag didn't come with him.
Police in charging documents said a K-9 named Beny conducted a "random scan" and alerted to possible drugs.
"Inside the bag were three large plastic bottles labeled as 'honey' of suspected liquid methamphetamine," charging documents said.
Haughton and Morris contend he was stereotyped because of his race. Authorities, Haughton's lawyer said, questioned him about "a big Jamaican gang and drug dealing conspiracy."
"'I'm 100 percent sure I don't have drugs,'" Haughton recalled insisting to agents. "'I only have honey.'"
Haughton had given up sugar years ago but drinks honey with his tea. He prefers honey from a particular bee farm in Jamaica because it is cheaper and "more pure" and always asks friends visiting the island to bring him back some.
Carey Phillips, Haughton's girlfriend, said that when he didn't come home from his Jamaica trip, she assumed he had extended his stay as he had done in the past and couldn't get in touch with her. But days later she got a letter from the Anne Arundel County detention center from Haughton.
"I was shocked," Phillips said. "It seems unreal to me. If someone does a crime, you understand, but if there's nothing, that time is wasted."
Haughton - facing at least 25 years in jail - appeared in court for a bail review two days after his arrest. A public defender at the hearing said Haughton had no prior convictions and had lived in the area for the past nine years. A judge agreed to let him go on work release, court files and recordings of the hearing show.
But more than three weeks later, Haughton was still behind bars.
The drug charges triggered detention orders from Customs officials, Haughton's lawyer said. Although the Maryland State Police lab returned test results on the bottles that indicated "No CDS detected" on Jan. 17, and although prosecutors had dropped the three felony drug counts on Jan. 23, Haughton still was facing a misdemeanor charge for possession of a controlled dangerous substance, or CDS.
Haughton asked to be released on Jan. 24 at his second bail review, but Anne Arundel County District Court Judge Laura M. Robinson worried he would not appear for trial.
"The problem is I can't let him go to ICE because he would be deported potentially," Robinson said, according to a recording of the hearing. "Even if I released you, you still wouldn't necessarily be released. You would go into federal detention."
Haughton was sent back to jail, appearing in court for a third bail review Feb. 5.
Morris, Haughton's lawyer, told the judge that Haughton should be released because the immigration detainer was triggered by the felony charges, which had been dropped. The federal government was in the middle of last winter's shutdown, and Morris said he couldn't reach anyone at Immigration and Customs Enforcement to lift the detainer.
"The thing that's going to end up happening, and they're going to realize it is, it's just honey," Morris said during the bail review. "He's been in jail for 30 days for honey."
Robinson said she would consider releasing Haughton on his own recognizance but only if the federal government pulled the detention order.
"The ICE detainer is really prohibitive," Robinson said. ". . . I'm kind of up against it on the ICE detainer."
Haughton went back to jail - again.
Had Haughton been stopped at any other location, according to multiple immigration lawyers, federal authorities probably would not have issued a detainer for him. But because Haughton was stopped at a port of entry at an airport, the felony charges probably triggered "inadmissibility proceedings," which require only that law enforcement officials have "reason to believe" someone is a drug trafficker to trigger possible deportation proceedings, according to the immigration lawyers.
The standard, however, is "murky," said Adina Appelbaum, program director of the Immigration Impact Lab at the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights (CAIR) Coalition.
As a basis for removing someone from the country, it is "concerning" because "of how broadly it can be interpreted and applied," Appelbaum said. "More broadly, this case demonstrates the disproportionate consequences that criminal offenses and allegations can have in the immigration realm, including for people who have lawful status for a green card."
Emma Winger, a staff attorney for the American Immigration Council, said Haughton's case is unusual in that he was detained over honey, but not surprising in other respects.
"It's not unusual that people who are held in criminal custody with ICE detainers have their detentions prolonged and then the charges are dismissed," Winger said.
Winger, like Morris, said the detainer for Haughton probably should have been dropped when the felony drug trafficking charges disappeared.
"Once it was down to possession and not drug dealing, that seems like a good reason to drop the detainer," Winger said. But, she added, "it's a little bit fuzzier because in theory, all Immigration needs to charge under this ground of inadmissibility is that they had probable cause" to believe Haughton was a drug trafficker who should be barred entry.          
Morris said he attempted to reach Immigration and Customs Enforcement multiple times to get the detention order lifted but couldn't make contact. Both Appelbaum said Winger said they are not surprised. It is generally difficult to reach someone at ICE to lift detainers for what may be considered low-priority cases, and during the shutdown, Appelbaum said, "there was a lot of chaos and no responses."
When asked about the case, Customs officials directed The Washington Post to Maryland Transportation Authority Police, which directed a reporter to prosecutors in the Anne Arundel County state's attorney's office. Prosecutors answered some questions about their case but directed The Post to the Department of Homeland Security over questions on Haughton's detainer.
ICE directed The Post back to Customs, where Steve Sapp, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said privacy laws prohibit the agency "from discussing specifics of any individual traveler's arrivals inspection."
Haughton recalls the emotions, the stress and the pain in his children's voices when they spoke on the phone while he was incarcerated.
"It broke me right down," Haughton said. Every time, they asked, " 'When are you coming home?' "
In explaining the need for two rounds of lab tests, Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Anne Colt Leitess said in an interview that the Maryland State Police crime lab is not equipped to analyze honey or liquid, so its results wouldn't have cleared Haughton.
Because the first test came up negative, she said, the state dropped the three felony drug charges but maintained the misdemeanor charge based on the drug K-9's hit and the positive field test while law enforcement sent the bottles to a Homeland Security lab in Georgia for more testing.
"The ICE detainer is really what is holding him," Leitess said. "He was not being held on anything with us."
For weeks, Morris emailed prosecutors asking for the status of the lab test out of Georgia. Then, at a court hearing on March 21 - a month and a half after Haughton's third bail review and nearly three months after his initial arrest - prosecutors dropped the final charge.
Haughton could go home.
Leitess said her office had no control over how quickly the second test results arrived but that it dropped the last charge against Haughton immediately after learning them.
Haughton said he's been trying to get his life back in order. He has a job driving a bread truck after losing his previous jobs while jailed. And his children are trying to improve their grades after the trauma of his disappearance affected their schoolwork.
Haughton says he is constantly trying to reassure his children - one of whom burst into tears when Haughton came home because she didn't recognize her father - that he isn't going to vanish again.
But some scars, Haughton said, won't go away.
"I'm scared to even travel right now," Haughton said. "You're innocent, and you can end up in jail."

Warren proposes reshaping immigration agencies, decriminalizing border crossings; Sen. Elizabeth Warren's new plan puts her on the liberal side of the immigration debate, setting up a potential political and social clash with Trump.

MILWAUKEE - Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Thursday called for remaking two major immigration enforcement agencies "from top to bottom" and establishing independent immigration courts, and she reiterated her support for decriminalizing border crossings in a wide-ranging plan to overhaul the country's immigration process.
The plan puts Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat running for president, firmly on the liberal side of the immigration debate. Her announcement comes as many Democratic voters are angered by reports of squalid conditions in U.S. border facilities, the separation of children from parents and President Trump's threats to deport "millions."
Other Democratic 2020 presidential contenders have also offered far-reaching immigration proposals, including Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who wants to close detention facilities with subpar conditions, and former Obama administration housing secretary Julián Castro, who first pushed for decriminalizing illegal border crossings. 
Much of the Warren proposal is framed as reversing actions taken by Trump. 
"Donald Trump wants to divide us - to pit worker against worker, neighbor against neighbor," Warren wrote in her plan. "We can be better than this. Americans know that immigrants helped weave the very fabric of our country in the past - and they know that immigrants belong here today."
Warren offered her plan ahead of an appearance Thursday, along with several other Democratic candidates, at a conference of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation's oldest Hispanic civil rights organization. 
Also Thursday, Castro reiterated his call to eliminate the legal provision that makes crossing the border illegally a criminal offense, saying it should be a civil offense instead. And he took sharp aim at former vice president Joe Biden for disagreeing.
"I saw that Vice President Biden said that he does not want to repeal Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It is a mistake for Vice President Biden to take that position," Castro said at a news conference. "It is clear that between him and me, one of us has learned the lessons of the past and the other hasn't."
Biden said recently on CNN that he opposes decriminalizing border crossings, and proposed other measures such as "surging" government personnel to the border to help make immigration decisions.
Much of Warren's immigration proposal would be enacted by executive action, a nod to the difficulty of passing immigration legislation through a bitterly divided Congress. 
That includes a pledge to "reshape" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which have faced scrutiny for their roles in carrying out the president's immigration agenda. Warren wants the two agencies to focus more directly on security-related functions, including "screening cargo, identifying counterfeit goods, and preventing smuggling and trafficking."
She also proposed ending the 287(g) and "Secure Communities" programs, which provide for local law enforcement agents to help identify and detain undocumented residents.  
Like several other Democratic candidates, Warren would restore or expand Obama-era initiatives, including offering asylum to those fleeing domestic or gang violence, along with gay, lesbian and transgender migrants seeking protection. She'd reactivate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects "dreamers" - undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children - from deportation. 
Warren would increase the annual cap on refugees allowed into the United States to 125,000, after that figure was cut to a historic low of 30,000 under the Trump administration.   
If the eventual Democratic nominee adopts such immigration policies, it would set up a major political and cultural clash with Trump, who has made cracking down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his political identity.
To address some of the root causes of migration, Warren would spend about $1.5 billion a year on aid programs in Central and South America.  
To fully enact her ideas, Warren would need cooperation from Congress, which for years has been unable to pass a broad immigration plan. 
That includes her plan to set up separate immigration courts modeled after the traditional federal courts. 
Warren argues that the current system, in which the Justice Department appoints immigration judges and the attorney general can overturn their rulings, puts too much power in the hands of the executive branch.
Greg Chen, director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said he was especially pleased with that part of Warren's plan, adding that the idea of creating an independent court system has some bipartisan support.
"What prevents it from happening is, it will cost money," Chen said. "It will take people rolling up their sleeves to make sure what is really institutional reform is done properly."
Although most of the plan is framed as a rebuke of Trump, Warren also took a veiled jab at Biden by noting that border crossings had been criminalized by former senator Coleman Livingston Blease (D-S.C.), whom she merely described as a "segregationist senator." Castro made a similar point in his remarks.
Biden has faced criticism for touting his working relationship with two segregationist senators early in his career despite disagreeing with them on racial matters, though he later apologized for his comments. He was not referring to Blease, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1924 to 1931.

Kimberly Breier, assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere since October, has resigned, leaving a key vacancy at the top of the diplomatic office in charge of the Trump administration's efforts to control immigration from Mexico and Central America and to build stronger partnerships in South America.
U.S. officials said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week accepted her letter of resignation, which cited personal reasons. Her departure is expected to be announced Thursday.
Earlier in her government career, Breier, who holds degrees in Spanish and Latin American studies, also handled regional issues as a CIA analyst and at the National Security Council under president George W. Bush. Immediately before becoming assistant secretary, she handled Latin American issues in the department's policy planning office.
Breier, 46, referred questions about her status to the State Department press office, which declined to comment. Several senior administration officials discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity because it concerns personnel.
She is the latest in a steady turnover at the assistant secretary level. Although Pompeo has filled many of the jobs left vacant by his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, a number are still held by acting officials, and at least four have departed this year, including A. Wess Mitchell, the top diplomat in charge of European affairs.
In May, Yleem Poblete, assistant secretary for arms control verification and compliance and a prominent Iran hawk, resigned. Poblete's views were reportedly more aligned with those of White House national security adviser John Bolton than her direct supervisor at the State Department. Earlier this month, Kiron Skinner, who headed the State Department office of policy planning, was forced out of her job over personnel clashes.
Officials said Breier, a Mexico expert, was not necessarily opposed to administration policies in the region but chafed at the level of control exerted by the White House over immigration and trade-dominated relations with Mexico and other matters.
One senior administration official said she had been chastised, in a particularly unpleasant recent email chain, by White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, who considered her insufficiently committed to publicly defending last month's sudden agreement over asylum between President Trump and the government of Guatemala.
The safe third country agreement requires Central American migrants to seek asylum in Guatemala and be rejected there before the United States will consider their asylum requests here. Pompeo reportedly objected to the White House-negotiated deal on grounds that Guatemala, one of the world's most violent countries, was not equipped to provide secure refuge for migrants fleeing Honduras and El Salvador.
Others in the department, some of whom have circulated for signatures a dissent channel memo on the subject, have also objected to it on the grounds that it violates U.S. asylum law.
Miller, the senior official said, pointed out to Breier that Trump had stood behind Kevin ­McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, and Guatemala's interior minister when they signed the deal and that it was "her job" to defend it.
Another senior official, however, sharply pushed back on that version of events and denied the email exchange existed. Among a number of officials who criticized or praised Breier, only one would go on the record. 
Ivanka Trump, on Twitter, said, "Thank you @WHAAsstSecty Kim Breier, for your friendship and great service." Posting a photograph of herself with Breier and Breier's daughter, Emma, Trump said that she and her husband, White House adviser Jared Kushner, "will miss working with you" but that "we are happy that Emma will now get to see more of the mom she is so proud of." 
It was not clear whether the Guatemala issue was a principal cause a principal cause of Breier's resignation. Other officials said Pompeo did not try to persuade her to stay. 
Breier has been known at State as strongly protective of what she saw as her prerogatives, according to a number of officials who have worked with her. 
In Latin America, Pompeo appointed a special envoy, Elliott Abrams, to lead diplomatic efforts on Venezuela, the biggest regional issue alongside immigration. Bolton and his senior director for the region, Mauricio Claver-Carone, have also played a significant public role in regional policy.
Breier is said to have been particularly effective in helping to boost U.S. relationships with new, right-leaning governments in South American countries such as Brazil.

Justice Dept. cancels internal news briefing after judges were sent link to anti-Semitic blog post

The Justice Department has canceled a news-clip service for employees in its immigration review office after Monday's edition included a link to and summary of a blog post from a white nationalist website that used an anti-Semitic slur, officials said Friday.
In an email Friday, employees at the department's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) were told "the Communications and Legislative Affairs Division will no longer distribute a daily news briefing within EOIR," and then gave the employees instructions for how to sign up for a different departmentwide briefing service if they wish to receive those notifications.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly said that after a review of the daily news aggregation emails, "we have determined that the sampling was over inclusive and contained non-news sources. EOIR will no longer be distributing a daily news briefing to its staff. EOIR strongly condemns anti-Semitism and white nationalism. Those hateful beliefs do not reflect the views of EOIR employees and the Department of Justice."
She said the office will not renew its contract with the private company, TechMIS, that provided the service. 
The Justice Department called the Florida-headquartered firm on Friday and explained its decision. The contract expires at the end of August .
TechMIS CEO Steve Mains said the company did its job as specified under the contract, and that Justice Department officials decided to share the material widely.
"We've been asked by them not to censor the news, so we provide the entire universe of news about EOIR and then what's distributed is up to them," said  Mains. "We provide it to them, they go through it with a fine tooth comb and decide what they want to keep, what they want to remove, and if they have any issues. ... If there's something out there that's particularly critical of a judge or someone in EOIR, it's our job, we were paid to provide that to EOIR and it's up to them whether they distribute it to everybody."
The controversy, which was first reported by Buzzfeed News, arose after a daily summary of news stories sent to employees Monday included a link to Vdare.com, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has branded a hate group. 
The Vdare post, about an effort by the Trump administration to possibly decertify the union representing immigration judges, singles out multiple judges by name, uses their photos and refers to them with an anti-Semitic slur. It also used a derogatory Nazi-era term for the media.
The Washington Post has found that an edited version of the same story, published under a different headline on a different website, was also sent out to EOIR employees again on Tuesday, but it did not include the controversial anti-Semitic term, or the Nazi-era reference to the media.
             The Justice Department sent the briefings to all EOIR employees, including its 400-some immigration judges, which means the judges named and pictured in the derogatory post also received the link to it this week - from their employer.
Staff did not receive a briefing email Friday morning.
The briefing email controversy arose the same week as President Trump faced accusations of anti-Semitism for asserting that Jewish people who vote for Democrats show "great disloyalty" and for praising Henry Ford, a virulent anti-Semite. 
The National Association of Immigration Judges lambasted the briefing in a letter to EOIR Director James McHenry. Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the group's president and one of the judges highlighted in the post, wrote that the union had received numerous complaints from judges across the country.
"The post features links and content that directly attacks sitting Immigration Judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs and the label 'Kritarch,' " Tabaddor said in the letter.
When used with a negative tone, the reference to kritarchy, a biblical term for a system of rule by judges in ancient Israel, is "deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic," she wrote. "VDare's use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control."

Trump attacks local leaders as he visits two cities grieving from mass shootings; Ahead of his trip, the president dismissed critics who suggested his rhetoric on race and immigration is partly to blame for a rise in hate-inspired violence, saying "my rhetoric brings people together."

EL PASO - On a day when President Trump vowed to tone down his rhetoric and help the country heal following two mass slayings, he did the opposite - lacing his visits Wednesday to El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, with a flurry of attacks on local leaders and memorializing his trips with grinning thumbs-up photos.
A traditional role for presidents has been to offer comfort and solace to all Americans at times of national tragedy, but the day provided a fresh testament to Trump's limitations in striking notes of unity and empathy.
When Trump swooped into the grieving border city of El Paso to offer condolences following the massacre of Latinos allegedly by a white supremacist, some of the city's elected leaders and thousands of its citizens declared the president unwelcome. 
In his only public remarks during the trip, Trump lashed out at Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, both Democrats, over their characterization of his visit with hospital patients in Dayton.
"We had an amazing day," Trump said in El Paso as he concluded his visit. "As you know, we left Ohio. The love, the respect for the office of the presidency."
Trump also praised El Paso police officers and other first responders and shook their hands, telling one female officer, "I saw you on television the other day and you were fantastic."
None of the eight patients still being treated at University Medical Center in El Paso agreed to meet with Trump when he visited the hospital, UMC spokesman Ryan Mielke said. Two victims who already had been discharged returned to the hospital with family members to meet with the president.
"This is a very sensitive time in their lives," Mielke said. "Some of them said they didn't want to meet with the president. Some of them didn't want any visitors."
Before Trump's visit Wednesday, however, some of the hospitalized victims accepted visits from a number of city and county elected officials, as well as Reps. Veronica Escobar (D-Tex.) and Jesús "Chuy" García (D-Ill.). 
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president and first lady Melania Trump met with "victims of the tragedy while at the hospital" and were "received very warmly by not just victims and their families, but by the many members of medical staff who lined the hallways to meet them. It was a moving visit for all involved." 
El Paso and Dayton were not merely the latest in the multiplying series of American mass shootings. The carnage in El Paso is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism, with parallels between a racist manifesto posted minutes before the shooting and the president's own anti-immigration rhetoric.
This has thrust Trump into the center of a roiling political and societal debate, with some Democratic leaders saying the president has emboldened white supremacy and is a threat to the nation.
Former vice president Joe Biden, who is running to unseat Trump in 2020, said in a speech Wednesday, "We have a president with a toxic tongue who has publicly and unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism and division."
Both in Dayton and El Paso, Trump kept almost entirely out of public view, a marked break with tradition, as presidents visiting grieving communities typically offer public condolences.
Trump avoided the Oregon district where the shooting in Dayton took place, and just a short drive from Miami Valley Hospital, which he did visit. Whaley said he would not have been welcome in the Oregon District, where scores of demonstrators congregated, holding ­anti-Trump signs and chanting "Do something!" in a call for stricter gun laws.
Brown and Whaley described the visit by the president and first lady in favorable terms. 
"They were hurting. He was comforting. He did the right things. Melania did the right things," Brown told reporters. "And it's his job in part to comfort people. I'm glad he did it in those hospital rooms."
Whaley added: "I think the victims and the first responders were grateful that the president of the United States came to Dayton."
Both Brown and Whaley, however, were also sharply critical of Trump's divisive rhetoric and Republican resistance to gun-control legislation.
Whaley later responded to Trump's comments about her and Brown by calling him "a bully and a coward." She said on CNN, "It's fine that he wants to bully me and Sen. Brown. We're okay. We can take it." 
The traveling press corps was not allowed to observe Trump's visit with three victims who remained hospitalized. It fell therefore to White House aide Dan Scavino to proclaim in a tweet that Trump "was treated like a Rock Star inside the hospital."
Trump and the first lady also met with police officers, fire officials, trauma surgeons and nurses at the facility, which treated 23 victims of the shooting. The hospital invited victims who had already been released to come back and meet with the president and the first lady.
"It was an authentic visit," hospital president Mike Uhl said, praising Trump as "attentive, present and extremely accommodating."
Trump offered his own affirmation on Twitter: "It was a warm & wonderful visit. Tremendous enthusiasm & even Love."
Grisham said journalists were kept out of the hospital visit because staff did not want it to devolve into "a photo op" and overwhelm the victims with media.
The White House, however, distributed its own photos of Trump smiling for pictures with first responders, along with a slickly produced video, helping make the president the center of attention.
Trump's reception in El Paso was less hospitable, and not only because so many local leaders have said they believe his rhetoric inspired Saturday's slayings at a shopping center near the U.S.-Mexico border. Although he won the state of Texas in the 2016 election, Trump captured just 25.7 percent of the vote in El Paso County, the worst performance recorded here by a major-party presidential candidate in at least two decades.
An ever-growing makeshift memorial has sprouted near the shooting scene that features piles of colorful flowers, a row of white crosses, a line of prayer candles, as well as messages to the president. "Mr. T, Respect our sorrow and grief. Do not 'invade' our city," reads one note, a reference to Trump's repeated warnings of a migrant "invasion" at the border.
Just before Trump arrived in El Paso - where he and the first lady met with law enforcement personnel at an emergency operations center following their hospital visit - several hundred people gathered in opposition to his trip.
Congregating under the hot midday sun in a baseball field for an "El Paso Strong" event, some held homemade signs. "Go home! You are NOT welcome here!" read one. "This was Trump-inspired terrorism," read another. "Trump repent," read a third.
At one point, the crowd chanted, "Send him back!" - a nod to the incendiary "Send her back!" chant about Somali-born Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) at one of Trump's campaign rallies last month.
"We feel like right now we should be in mourning, and we feel like we should be collecting our thoughts, we should be doing vigils and we should be gathering together as a community. We believe it is an insult that the president is coming here," said one of the organizers, Jaime Candelaria, a 37-year-old singer and songwriter.
Escobar said onstage, "In this moment, someone is visiting ... I felt it was important that we come together and not focus on the visitor, but focus on El Paso." She added, "We will not stop resisting the hate! Resisting the bigotry! Resisting the racism!" 
During his flight home from El Paso, Trump attacked Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), the twin brother of presidential candidate Julián Castro, tweeting that he "makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth." The congressman has come under scrutiny for publicizing a list of San Antonio donors who have contributed to Trump and accusing them of "fueling a campaign of hate." 
On Saturday in El Paso, authorities said, a man opened fire inside the Walmart, killing 22 people and injuring two dozen others. At 1:05 a.m. Sunday, a gunman killed nine people and injured 27 others outside a bar in Dayton, police said.
All week, Trump has zigzagged between two competing instincts: unite and divide.
In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Trump remained cloistered at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., issuing only short statements on Twitter. Back at the White House on Monday, the president delivered a scripted speech in which he preached harmony.
"Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside - so destructive - and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion and love," Trump said, reading from teleprompters.
The president did not heed his own advice, however. Late Tuesday night, he took to Twitter to attack Beto O'Rourke, the former El Paso congressman running for president who has said Trump bears some responsibility for the shooting there because of his demonization of Latino immigrants.
Trump tweeted: "Beto (phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage) O'Rourke, who is embarrassed by my last visit to the Great State of Texas, where I trounced him, and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1% in the Democrat Primary, should respect the victims & law enforcement - & be quiet!"
Then, as he departed the White House on Wednesday morning en route to Ohio, Trump told reporters he would refrain from attacking his adversaries during the trip.
"I would like to stay out of the political fray," the president said. Asked about his rhetoric, he said he thinks it "brings people together" and added, "I think we have toned it down."
That detente lasted only a few minutes. Answering a reporter's question about Biden, Trump pounced. "Joe is a pretty incompetent guy," the president said. "Joe Biden has truly lost his fastball, that I can tell you."
By the time the president had left Dayton, he was back on Twitter and sniping at Democrats, a tirade triggered by his consumption of cable television news aboard Air Force One.
"Watching Sleepy Joe Biden making a speech. Sooo Boring! The LameStream Media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy," the president wrote.
Then he lashed out at Brown and Whaley, falsely accusing them of "totally misrepresenting" the reception he received at Miami Valley Hospital. He alleged that their news conference immediately after the president's visit "was a fraud."
But neither Brown nor Whaley said Trump received a poor reception at the hospital.
When Whaley first saw Trump's tweets criticizing her and Brown, she paused for a moment to read them on a cellphone and said, "I don't - I mean, I'm really confused. We said he was treated, like, very well. So, I don't know why they're talking about 'misrepresenting.'
"Oh, well, you know," the mayor added with a shrug. "He lives in his world of Twitter."
             Correction: A previous version of this story included a reference to Shawn Nixon, 20, who identified himself Wednesday as an employee who was in an El Paso Walmart store when it was attacked over the weekend by a shooter who killed 22 people. Walmart said in a statement Thursday that he "was not an associate at store 2201 at the time of the shooting." Nixon also acknowledged in an interview Thursday that he was not a Walmart employee, but said he was in the store during the attack. The reference and comments from Nixon have been removed from the story.

Immigration lawyers say Justice Dept. ruling could undercut thousands of asylum cases

A ruling from the U.S. attorney general could upend the asylum claims of thousands of Central Americans and other asylum seekers who say they deserve protection in the United States because they belong to families that are victims of drug cartels or other criminals in their homelands.
The nation's top prosecutor, Attorney General William P. Barr, issued the ruling Monday, partially reversing a 2017 Board of Immigration Appeals decision in the asylum case of a Mexican national who said a drug cartel targeted him and his family. Barr said that just because members of ordinary families fall victim to "private criminal activity" does not mean they can claim asylum protections in the United States on that basis.
Federal law allows immigrants to claim asylum based on a fear of persecution in their homelands because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a "particular social group," which for years has included families targeted by gangs, drug cartels or others.
But Barr wrote "genetic ties" alone are insufficient to establish that a migrant is a member of a particular social group. He wrote that to qualify for protection, families should also be "socially distinct" in some way, such as the "large and prominent" clans that have been persecuted in some countries.
Such families, Barr wrote, "stand on a very different footing from an alien's immediate family, which generally will not be distinct on a societal scale, whether it attracts the attention of criminals who seek to exploit that family relationship in the service of their crimes."
Barr said an asylum seeker's family should be distinct "in the eyes of its society, not just those of its alleged persecutor."
He said the Board of Immigration Appeals "improperly recognized" the man's family as a particular social group in 2017 after conducting a "cursory" analysis of the issue. The board actually denied the man asylum for other reasons, and his case is still pending in the immigration courts.
A spokesman for the Justice Department, which runs the immigration courts, said the agency does not track how many asylum claims are based on family relationships.
The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit organization that represents the Mexican citizen in this case, called the decision "shameful" and said it will make it more difficult for immigrants to qualify for asylum, particularly those who are not from elite, well-known families.
Lawyers will probably challenge Barr's decision in federal court.
A top official of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services emailed asylum officers Monday afternoon and implored them to ensure they "are processing cases consistent with this decision immediately," according to a copy of the email obtained by The Washington Post. "Additional information and guidance will be forthcoming, but we wanted to make you aware of the decision as soon as possible so you can begin applying it to your pending cases."
Lawyers said the ruling also came up in immigration courts where people are facing deportation.
"That's the real danger of this form of decision-making," Bradley Jenkins, federal litigation attorney at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, said Monday in response to the ruling. "It's absolutely going to have a tragic impact even though the legal merit of the decision is questionable."
Barr's ruling is one in a string of decisions the Justice Department has issued to narrow the ways immigrants can seek refuge in the United States, part of a broader effort to reduce mass migration at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The White House says the U.S. government is overrun by asylum seekers who are filing frivolous claims designed to gain entry into the United States so they can find work and other economic opportunity. Advocates say migrants are fleeing violence, poverty and hunger and should have their day in court.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has pressured Mexico to interdict migrants on their way to the United States as well as host thousands of them until the United States summons them to court.
The Trump administration also has developed a policy that disqualifies most asylum seekers if they passed through another country, such as Mexico, on their way to the United States. A federal judge temporarily blocked that policy last week, but in a separate action Monday the Justice Department said it would seek an emergency appeal.
"The executive branch is entitled to use every legal tool available to stem the flow of aliens who lack valid asylum claims," the department said in court filings.
Lawyers say Barr's ruling conflicts with long-standing legal precedents in multiple federal court circuits that have recognized the family unit as a "social group." The 1st Circuit has said there is "no plainer example," the 4th Circuit called the family unit a "prototypical" social group, and the 9th Circuit said family units are "quintessential" groups.
Jeremy McKinney, a vice president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, called Barr's ruling "a poorly reasoned decision from an administration that seems intent on ending legal asylum."
"I predict this decision is going to have a very short shelf life," he said. "Once it makes its way to the courts of appeal, you're going to see it reversed."
Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said the White House ordered federal agencies last year to produce more comprehensive data detailing the basis for asylum claims, but that information has not been released publicly.
Pierce said Barr's ruling could still have a broad impact because so many asylum claims by Central Americans are based on gang threats, which are often aimed at entire families.
"This will make it more complicated to apply for asylum, and more necessary to have legal counsel," Pierce said.
The Mexican citizen in Barr's ruling, known only by the initials L.E.A., first entered the United States illegally 21 years ago and was ordered to leave in 2011 after a conviction for driving under the influence.
The man left voluntarily, but he returned months later because he said the powerful drug cartel known as La Familia Michoacana attempted to coerce him and his father to sell drugs from his father's general store in Mexico City. He said people from the cartel fired gunshots near him and tried to abduct him.
A U.S. immigration judge denied the request for asylum because the man could not prove that he or other relatives were targeted as a family.
The Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that the man had proved that his father's immediate family constituted a social group but denied the request for asylum because the man could not prove that relatives were also targets.
Barr's ruling sent the case back to the immigration judge. The man, who lives in California, will apply for a lesser form of protection from deportation, his lawyers said.

The Trump administration is making legal immigration harder, too

Politicians who believe our immigration system is too porous routinely say that those seeking to come to the United States should just "wait in line." That phrase, of course, presupposes an orderly and fair legal immigration process. Given changes introduced by the new masters of that process, the phrase "line up for the gauntlet" might be more appropriate.
Many of these changes have transpired within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency tasked by Congress with administering immigration benefits. I served as the agency's director from 2014 to 2017. In February 2018, USCIS updated its mission statement, eliminating the reference to those seeking immigration benefits - individuals and employers who often pay sizable fees for benefits adjudication - as "customers," while airbrushing away USCIS's aim to "realize the United States' promise as a nation of immigrants." The newer, colder statement of purpose parallels the agency's evolution from the service-oriented mission that earlier leaders of both parties had championed toward the restrictionist aims of many in the Trump administration.
While this shift has unfolded, the agency's adjudications have become so backed up that the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing earlier this month to explore the causes and harmful consequences of its severe case processing delays. As a former director, I know full well that those delays are not solely the result of the current administration's policies; they stem from a variety of factors, many inherent in the agency's processes and budget development model. Still, USCIS case processing times have climbed sharply under President Trump, even as the volume of new applications has declined and the agency's budget has risen. In her testimony, Marketa Lindt, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, observed that the average USCIS case processing time increased 46 percent from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018.
During that span, the Trump administration has implemented a range of unwarranted policies and practices that directly lengthen processing times. Because of one of these policies, every employer-sponsored green card applicant must now appear for an in-person interview, even though there's no practical justification for such interviews except in a small group of cases that appear to have higher potential to undermine public safety or the integrity of the immigration system. These across-the-board interviews drain limited resources and prolong the waits for people seeking employment in the United States, as well as those trying to reunite with their families or achieve full civic integration by becoming citizens. Similarly, the percentage of cases for which USCIS requests supplemental evidence - evidence that is often duplicative or irrelevant - has skyrocketed. In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, USCIS issued "Requests for Evidence" for 60 percent of all H-1B petitions, a rate nearly three times as high as in fiscal 2016.
Even as processing times for immigration benefits have surged, the agency has increasingly redirected its resources away from fulfilling its statutory mission as a benefits agency. Importantly, USCIS's own website not only acknowledges that mission, but also distinguishes it from the missions of the two other Department of Homeland Security immigration agencies (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection), stating: "We were formed to enhance the security and improve the efficiency of national immigration services by exclusively focusing on the administration of benefit applications. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), components within DHS, handle immigration enforcement and border security functions."
But the administration seems to hold the view that USCIS should, instead, take on the enforcement work of ICE and CBP. The day after the hearing about the delays - during which USCIS attributed a large part of the backlog to a lack of resources and personnel - reports revealed an email sent by the agency's headquarters to its staff members asking that they volunteer to perform administrative duties at ICE field offices nationwide. Earlier this month, the new USCIS director - perhaps at the behest and certainly with the blessing of the White House - could be seen all over mass media promising ICE raids against people with final deportation orders, although such actions are nowhere within the jurisdiction of the agency he runs. And the Trump administration's proposed 2020 budget seeks to transfer more than $200 million in applicant fees out of USCIS into ICE to pay for, among other things, hundreds of ICE enforcement officer positions, even though USCIS officials asserted under oath that budget and fiscal constraints do not allow USCIS to hire the volume of personnel needed to process its caseload.
I am no ICE abolitionist. Smart enforcement of immigration laws protects the safety and security of the nation. But by congressional design, USCIS is not ICE, nor is it subordinate to it. That separation of functions is precisely what positions USCIS to act as the service-oriented gateway through which vital international talent and enterprise reach the United States, through which U.S. citizens reunite with loved ones from abroad - through which we can advance our national security interests by administering humanitarian programs that distinguish the United States as a beacon of freedom.
A USCIS true to its statutory mission is vital to our safety, economy, and the well-being of our families and communities. When USCIS no longer recognizes itself as the benefits agency Congress intended; when the line between USCIS and ICE substantially blurs; when USCIS's policies act to stymie our legal immigration system rather than facilitate it, all of us suffer.
If our officials have forgotten this, the nation needs them to remember, and fast. The legal immigration system is at stake. And so is the future of our country.

Building shelters in D.C. would help migrants, not hurt them; By opposing new facilities for migrant children, local officials become part of the problem.

MANY AMERICANS are rightly outraged by the Trump administration's treatment of migrant children, who have been separated from parents and ill-treated by authorities. Democrats have been understandably eager to distance themselves from such policies - a stance that can result in knee-jerk opposition even to sensible practices in effect during the Obama administration.
That might explain the nearly uniform outcry from Washington-area politicians incensed at federal plans to build new shelters for migrant children in Northern Virginia and the District . The shelters, state-licensed and similar to scores across the county in operation since before President Trump took office, would help move migrant children out of squalid, cramped Border Patrol stations near the U.S.-Mexico border. They would provide a way station for unaccompanied minors while federal officials seek to place them with U.S.-based relatives or foster families.
But local politicians, nearly all Democrats, have balked at cooperating with federal authorities on any immigration matter. They have denounced the proposed new shelters with objections that smack of NIMBYism masquerading as humane concern for children. This month, the administration of D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D)  enacted  emergency rules that blocked a planned federal shelter.
There are currently some 8,700 minors, mainly teenagers, housed in about 170 such shelters nationwide. For most, the stay in those facilities is relatively brief - on average,  a little more than six weeks, until the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, places them with relatives or foster families. Those facilities had  insufficient beds to handle the surge of unaccompanied minors who crossed the border earlier this year, hence the appalling images of children stuck in jam-packed Border Patrol outposts and emergency detention centers.
By building new shelters, the government would add future capacity to avoid such bottlenecks and terrible conditions in the event of another spike in border crossings. That's smart. So why the objections from local leaders, including Ms.  Bowser  and the top elected leaders in suburban Fairfax and Loudoun counties?  
The answer seems at least partly to be political optics; by cooperating in any way with the administration's immigration moves, they might fear being seen as complicit. Ms. Bowser called the shelters "warehouses" that dehumanize migrant children; she insisted the facility proposed for the District (planned capacity, 200 beds) was too big. Sharon Bulova (D-At Large), the chair of Fairfax County's Board of Supervisors, has associated the proposed shelters with family separation while stopping short of outright opposition.
In fact, the shelters have nothing to do with family separation. That abhorrent policy ended last year; the vast majority of migrant children currently in shelters entered the country unaccompanied. Nor are they "warehouses." Existing shelters, scattered in 23 states including Virginia, provide a range of services, including English instruction, health care, counseling, access to legal aid and recreation - just as they did during the Obama administration.
The opposition does not withstand scrutiny. The shelters are not an outgrowth of the Trump administration's odious immigration policies; they're a preexisting cog in the machinery for resettling migrant children. By blocking them, local officials would become part of the problem by contributing to future logjams and inhumane conditions at the border. That's a bad outcome for those who profess to care about treating immigrants humanely.

Immigration, a central issue for Trump, also key issue at Democratic debate; Democrats say they will work to quickly erase President Trump's policies on immigration, but they also have to face their own party's efforts to increase enforcement under President Obama.

A second wave of Democratic contenders seeking to oust President Trump from the White House backed a path to U.S. citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in a debate Thursday night that called for a new era in immigration policy.
The 10 Democrats onstage in Miami signaled that they had been whipsawed by Trump's massive immigration crackdown, a central aspect of his presidency and something he has been emphasizing as he embarks on his reelection campaign.
Trump's tough-on-immigration tactics have included a "zero-­tolerance" policy last year that separated thousands of parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border, an attempt to rescind deportation reprieves for young immigrants known as Dreamers, expanding immigration jails to hold a record 54,000 immigrants a day - up from approximately 33,000 a day under Obama - and forcing thousands of asylum seekers to await their immigration court hearings in Mexico. 
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said Trump has "torn apart the moral fabric of who we are." South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg called the president's family separation policy "dead wrong." And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) vowed to use his executive authority, if elected, to erase Trump's policies.
"On day one, we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done," Sanders said to cheers.
But the Democrats also had to confront the party's role in creating and funding a federal immigration system that set the stage for Trump's tighter enforcement.
President Barack Obama backed a path to U.S. citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, but he also pushed immigration enforcement and ramped up deportations. By the end of his second term, Obama had removed more than 2 million immigrants from the country and failed to pass immigration reform. Critics called him the "Deporter in Chief." 
Trump deported 256,000 migrants last fiscal year, far lower than the 400,000 people Obama's administration deported in 2012. Trump recently vowed to deport "millions" of migrants as a way to thwart an unprecedented influx of Central American families streaming to the southern border. 
Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) distanced herself from Obama on immigration during the debate, noting that she had opposed his expansion of Secure Communities, a fingerprint-sharing program that alerts Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an immigrant is arrested for a state or local crime, including minor traffic offenses.
"I disagreed with my president," she said.
She and others said migrants with little or no criminal records should not be deported. 
Joe Biden, who served as Obama's vice president, said that administration sought to address "root" causes of migration, and he pledged to surge "billions" of dollars to Central America to invest in development and encourage people to stay in their homelands. Biden defended Obama's record.
"Compare him to what this guy's doing," he said, referring to Trump.
All 10 candidates said they would support public health care for undocumented immigrants.
The candidates' broad support for a path to citizenship for undocumented migrants failed to acknowledge the difficulty of passing an immigration law that would make it possible. Congress has not found common ground on comprehensive immigration legislation since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan signed a law that gave legal status to approximately 3 million immigrants.
Since then, the undocumented population has more than tripled to 10.5 million, and the Pew Research Center says a typical immigrant has lived in the United States for nearly 15 years. Many have U.S.-born children. 
Immigration dominated the first round of the Democratic debate Wednesday night, when Julián Castro, a former secretary of housing and urban development under Obama, challenged rivals to repeal the legal code that makes crossing the border illegally a federal misdemeanor. 
The Trump administration had used that law to prosecute parents and separate them from their children at the border last year, because children could not be held in criminal jails. The policy drew bipartisan condemnation.
The Obama administration also prosecuted thousands of immigrants every year for the misdemeanor and other immigration crimes and then swiftly deported them, according to the American Immigration Council. 
Lawyers and migrant advocates say Democrats were largely silent on Obama's immigration enforcement, but they say Trump's policies have opened the door to a more comprehensive immigration overhaul.
"The issue is more top of mind than it is has ever been in the 20-plus years that I've been involved in this issue," said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. "I wish they had been there in the Obama administration. We could've stopped this way before it got as bad as it is now. I'll take latecomers to the party rather than nobody showing up."
Lorella Praeli, deputy political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said "everyone onstage has to feel a sense of accountability for the kind of system that we have inherited and that has been built over several decades."
But she said Trump's enforcement policies force a question: What kind of immigration system does the country want to have? 
"We didn't have this conversation in 2016," she said.
Cecilia Muñoz, former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Obama, said he could be "fairly" criticized for taking too long to set priorities on immigration enforcement. But he ultimately sought to limit deportations to recent border crossers and people convicted of serious crimes, and avoided targeting millions of immigrants with no criminal history.
She said the next administration will have to find a way to address the surge of migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2016, most migrants sneaking across the border were adults, who are easy to detain and deport from the United States.
Now, parents and minors account for 65 percent of those pouring across the border and into crowded border facilities. More than 144,000 people were taken into custody at the border in May, the highest number in more than a decade.
"The fact of the matter is this would be a crisis under any administration," she said. "Anybody that wants to get ready to govern is going to have to contend with this."

It's how we treat other people's children that matters; Caring only for ourselves goes against America's national character.

It is not an act of particular virtue to love your children and treat them well; instinct and evolution privilege our own kids, and from the moment they blink into the world, we would risk anything for their safety, sacrifice anything for their happiness.
It's how we treat other people's children that measures and tests us today. And here, as we shudder at the impact of his immigration policies on families, I can't help but think that President Trump is channeling parents on both the right and the left who've decided that other people's children don't matter, as long as their own get ahead. 
Anyone asserting the existence of certain universal values could always default to this: No decent society would ever argue that it's okay to torture children. Which made it all the more chilling when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Mississippi swept up about 680 undocumented workers, leaving some children to return from the first day of school to locked houses, missing parents and shattered families. The spectacle - and it was flaunted as a spectacle, the largest one-state immigration enforcement effort in U.S. history - does not just challenge us on how best to balance politics, economics and justice. It asks us, "When is it okay to torment other people's kids?"
For Trump, the answer was clear and blithely callous: "This serves as a very good deterrent," he declared. What parent watching the sobbing children would dare step foot across a border illegally? "I just hope to keep it up," he said.   
You don't have to be an apologist for open borders to conclude that there are ways to promote security that stop short of emotional torture. Yes, children often suffer when parents commit crimes, but that is the collateral damage of enforcement, not its goal. 
Still, the mentality that justifies harming children so long as they're not your own is not unique to the president. From the beginning of this year to mid-August,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed more than 1,200 cases of measles, the most since 2000. Arrogance plus ignorance takes its toll: Parents who won't "risk" vaccinating their own children discount the risk to others. If they think vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they prevent, they should hope other parents stop vaccinating, as well. But more likely they are counting on others to comply so that their own children can have the best of all worlds: no vaccine and little chance of exposure to disease. 
In a different way but in the same spirit, the psychotically ambitious parents of the "Varsity Blues" college admissions scandal did not care who they deprived of a spot at Stanford or the University of Southern California as long as their children succeeded. Unlike many things in life, college admissions is zero-sum; an unqualified student who bribes her way in takes a spot from someone who tried to earn it. Need extra time for the SAT? Get a doctor to diagnose a learning disability. Between 2009 and 2016, the number of students getting special accommodations more than doubled, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. At one school in affluent Westchester County, N.Y., nearly 1 in 5 students had special testing privileges, which was nearly 10 times the national average.  
These are starling parents, like the birds that destroy other birds' eggs to take their nests and protect their own. For if every parent puts his or her child first at all costs, communities degrade, schools can't function, society becomes ungovernable. And while they are not natural objects of sympathy, the cheaters' children suffer, as well. The most obvious victims are the ones who end up sick or disabled by infections that could have been avoided. But moral infection eats you from the inside, rots relationships, wounds self-worth. As the college admissions scandal unfolded, I kept wondering what scars the parents' ambitions left on their children. "The ruin of a nation,"  a Ghanian proverb warns, "begins in the homes of its people." 
Which brings us back to our larger family. America's identity derives from ideals that set us apart from the places we left to come here: freedom and fairness, justice and mercy, where anyone with moxie and muscle can build a future. We care for our neighbors; we honor service and sacrifice. Soldiers died for these values; parents watched sons and daughters go to war, sacrifice that which was most precious, to defend something bigger than ourselves. 
This president doesn't seem to think very much of our national character. He discounts our instinctive generosity to those in need, our compassion not just for our own children but all children, our confidence that we can succeed together, not just at each other's expense. 
What happens when nothing is bigger than oneself, no value is worth sacrificing for and it's every man for himself? We are finding out.

Trump-era politics are drowning out consensus on immigration. It's time for some straight talk.; Yes, we need fair and compassionate immigration policy. And yes, we need to secure our border.

             Jeh Charles Johnson was homeland security secretary from 2013 to 2017.          
Americans are and should be outraged at reports of migrants detained in dirty, overcrowded conditions near the Southern border. This is not how the United States should endeavor to treat people desperate for a better life. Meanwhile, highly offensive social media conversations that reportedly occurred among Border Patrol personnel are unforgivable but are at odds with my own observations of Border Patrol agents, who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants found tired and hungry on our Southern border.
It's time for some straight talk on immigration. There is almost none left in the highly emotional and politicized environment of the Trump era.
To govern in the immigration space and accomplish meaningful change requires compromise across Democratic and Republican lines. Very few solutions are black or white. Polls reflect that most Americans want to see two basic things when it comes to immigration: that we are fair and compassionate to those immigrants who have become honest and integrated members of our society (most notably the "dreamers") and that we secure our borders. This broad consensus is drowned out in the current political debate, but it is actually the place from which the Obama administration tried to govern. We fought for comprehensive immigration reform in Congress, created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in 2012, tried to expand upon it in 2014, focused our resources on deporting major felons and saw some of the lowest numbers of apprehensions on our Southern border in decades.
As someone who for three years owned the difficult issue of immigration generally and enforcing border security specifically, I know these hard lessons:
First, high volumes of illegal immigration on our Southern border (and the tragic overcrowding at holding centers that follows) cannot be truly solved unless we make the long-term investment to reduce poverty and violence in Central America. Congress and the Obama administration began with an investment of $750 million in 2016, but the yearly investment has decreased since, and Trump has now suspended it altogether. This is the exact wrong thing to do. State and Homeland Security officials have told me the modest assistance so far was starting to make a difference.
Second, we cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy to not deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our Southern border - about or more than 100,000 - by multiples. For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are in fact rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous "zero-tolerance" policy).
The Obama administration's immigration priorities for deportation included both those who committed major crimes and those who were apprehended at the Southern border. Those apprehended at the border were allowed to remain this country while their deportation and asylum cases proceeded to conclusion.
Third, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has attracted criticism from the left for accepting last week a more moderate version of legislation to provide humanitarian aid to migrants at the border. The media sensationalized the speaker's agreement as a "striking defeat" and a "capitulation." Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted.
All this comes amid a larger alarming trend in today's politics, on both sides of the aisle. To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base - and simply for the sake of a good applause line - candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent.
As a child of the 1960s, I'm as idealistic as anyone. As someone who has held public office and took that responsibility seriously, I also know to be realistic. Those who aspire to public office should not espouse campaign promises that have no prospect for success - this is a disservice to our democracy and assumes voters are fools.
Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths. This trait has all but evaporated in U.S. politics, but it is the single best job qualification for those who aspire to lead. I'm a Democrat, and whoever among the current Democratic field of candidates demonstrates this profile in courage will earn my vote.
