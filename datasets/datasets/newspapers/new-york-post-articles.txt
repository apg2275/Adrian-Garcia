  Federal authorities have released 300 of the nearly 700 workers detained in the Mississippi immigration raids on Wednesday, according to officials. 
  "Approximately 30 detained aliens were released yesterday on humanitarian grounds at the individual sites," said the US Attorney's Office for the state's Southern District in a press release Thursday. 
  "Another 270 detained aliens were released after being processed by HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] at the National Guard base in Pearl and returned to the place where they were originally encountered." 
   Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted the raids Wednesday at seven food-processing plants in central Mississippi.  
  ICE agents asked the workers when they arrived at the immigration processing center whether they had any children who were at school or child care and needed to be picked up, according to DOJ officials. 
  It is believed that "all children were with at least one of their parents as of [Wednesday] night," they said.

  How do you stop the torrent of kids risking their lives and coming to America illegally? One key way: by finally fixing the Flores agreement, as President Trump hopes to do. 
  Wednesday, Trump unveiled a plan to scrap the 20-day limit on keeping migrant kids in detention. The cap, in effect since 2015 and part of the 1997 Flores consent decree, set up a Catch-22: If kids can't be held more than 20 days, and no one wants to separate them from their parents (or other adults they come with), then the only option is to release the whole family. 
  That creates an enormous incentive for adult migrants to bring kids along, even if the journey puts them in danger. And it makes America's immigration system unworkable. 
  Pro-immigration advocates, of course, blast the plan, calling it a cruel way to cut immigration: "This new rule is about letting President Trump . . .skeep children in awful conditions for longer periods of time and continue the administration's horrid treatment of innocent migrant families," huffs Sen. Chuck Schumer. 
  Memo to Schumer: Migrant families who cross illegally and try to game the system aren't exactly "innocent." And clearly, there's a problem: Almost 475,000 families crossed the border in the last 10 months, notes Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan. Does Schumer want them all to simply disappear throughout the country, with no vetting or processing or waiting their turn? 
  The rule can be implemented humanely: It spells out standards for detention centers, including health care, education and food. Congress can improve on them, if it likes, and provide funding. And by the way, past presidents, including President Barack Obama, sought similar fixes. 
  Democrats like Schumer would prefer no detentions at all - just let migrants come right in. But Trump is offering a humane way to, as McAleenan put it, enforce laws Congress passed. And ensure some order to the immigration process.

  The United States would be able to indefinitely detain migrant families who cross the border illegally, under a regulation unveiled Wednesday by the Trump administration. 
  The move would eliminate a previous 20-day limit as judges weigh asylum requests. 
  The proposed rule, which would replace a 1997 federal-court deal that limits how long US authorities can hold migrant children, is bound to spark a new court fight about immigrants' rights. 
  President Trump also told reporters Wednesday that his administration was seriously considering ending the right of citizenship for children born in the US to noncitizens. 
  "We're looking at that very seriously, birthright citizenship, where you have a baby on our land, you walk over the border, have a baby - congratulations, the baby is now a US citizen . . . It's frankly ridiculous," the president said on the South Lawn. 
  The proposal could face legal challenges, as the 14th Amendment, passed after the Civil War, granted citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States." 
  Homeland Security officials say they have caught 390,000 family "units" since October as immigration authorities struggle to handle a surge of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. 
  "Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system," Acting Homeland Secretary Kevin ­McAleenan said in a statement. 
  "This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in US government custody are treated with dignity, respect and special concern for their particular vulnerability." 
  Team Trump has been pressing DHS to replace the so-called Flores agreement, which requires the US to keep children in the least restrictive setting and to release them as quickly as possible, generally after 20 days. 
  When the agreement went into effect under the Obama administration, the number of children being picked up annually at the border surged from about 6,700 to 90,000, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
  The agreement also put families in a precarious legal situation, as the kids were legally required to be released while their parents were meant to stay in detention.  
  This prompted more families to cross the border with their children in the hopes they would be released together.  
  The new regulation - which requires a federal judge's approval before it could go into effect - would establish standards for conditions in detention centers. It would specifically abolish the 20-day limit, which prompted Trump to criticize the "catch and release" of migrants into the US. 
  The proposed regulation is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Friday and would take effect 60 days later, although it will likely be delayed because of expected court challenges. 
  New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said of the new regulation, "The cruelty of the Trump administration knows no bounds. 
  "Make no mistake: This new rule is about letting President Trump and Stephen Miller keep children in awful conditions for longer periods of time and continue the administration's horrid treatment of innocent migrant families fleeing unthinkable hardship." 
  Miller is a senior White House adviser and immigration hard-liner. 
  "Having seen firsthand the awful conditions the Trump administration subjects many migrant families to, it is imperative that the courts immediately block this rule from going into effect," Schumer added. 
  The 20-day limit has been in effect since 2015 as a result of a 1997 court- ordered consent decree after a federal class-action lawsuit alleged physical and emotional harm done to migrant children held for long periods. 
  Peter Schey, a lawyer for the immigrant children in the Flores case and president of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said if the new regulations don't match the settlement, "they would be in immediate material breach, if not contempt of court." 
   Schey told CBS News that he expects the judge who oversees the Flores case to reject the White House efforts. 
  "These regulations do not implement the settlement. In fact, it abrogates the settlement. And so I think their efforts will be futile," he said. 
  The administration hopes to circumvent the 20-day detention limit by creating a federal licensing system to authorize facilities the government can use to hold families with children. 
  Trump defended the proposed regulation by saying he has the children on his mind. "It bothers me very greatly. People make this horrible 2,000-mile journey," he said.  
  "One of the things that will happen, when they realize the border is closing, the wall is being built . . . when they see you can't get into the United States - or when they see if they do get into the United States, they will be brought back to their country - they won't come. And many people will be saved,"

The anti Ocasio runs in Illinois Latina candidate: I'm American first!

  A conservative young Latina from Illinois is running for Congress as the anti-AOC. 
  Republican Catalina Lauf, 26, who is hoping to snag a Democratic-held seat outside Chicago, supports President Trump's border wall, cites Ronald Reagan as an idol and hopes to be a counterweight to Rep. Alexandria ­Ocasio-Cortez's congressional "Squad." 
  If Lauf wins the seat, she would break the 29-year-old Bronx-Queens representative's record as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. 
  "I think it's time that people step forward who want to unite the country and do it for the right reasons," Lauf told The Post. 
  The self-described "lifelong conservative" announced on Tuesday that she is running in the state's 14th Congressional District west of the Windy City - and will be taking on incumbent Democrat Lauren Underwood. 
   Lauf is a former Trump- administration adviser from Wood­stock, Ill., who describes herself as "Latina by heart, American first" - born to an American father and Guatemalan mother. 
  In her announcement video, Lauf said Ocasio-Cortez was among the "angry voices who seek to divide us." 
  "I think people like AOC and that group are focusing on an agenda that is so detrimental to our country," she told The Post. 
  "They are not being leaders. They are part of the problem." 
  When questioned about being a minority woman supportive of Trump, Lauf said she wanted strong borders and denied claims that the president was racist. 
  "I'm the daughter of a legal immigrant," she said. "We're for legal immigration. That's not racism. You should be a law-abiding citizen." 
  The offspring of a small-business owner, Lauf described herself as a proud capitalist who grew up working in her entrepreneurial father's various businesses. 
  While studying at Miami University of Ohio, Lauf became involved in a college Republican group before obtaining a bachelor's degree in communications at the age of 20. 
  Describing politics as her "calling," she worked for Uber in Chicago in community partnerships before becoming a special adviser to the ­Department of Commerce last year. 
  Lauf said she felt compelled to run for after Underwood this month called for the impeachment of Trump. 
  Lauf accused the 32-year-old incumbent of not representing the mostly rural, traditionally Republican district that the Democrats narrowly won with 52.5 percent of the vote in the 2018 midterm election. 
  "I want to break the stereotype that Republicans aren't empathetic," she said. 
  "Being Republican doesn't mean I don't care."

  There's always Fashion Week drama, but we don't remember a trade war being the cause of it before. Fashion functionaries fear that President Trump's tariff battle with China could interfere with September's Fashion Week - which is increasingly attracting Chinese designers - after a Chinese designer and her entire staff were denied visas to come to New York for their shows. Xiaojuan Yang, designer of the I Love Pretty line, applied for a B1 business visa at the American consulate in Guangzhou, China, but was summarily turned down. 
Said an insider, "No particular reason was given. [She was just] given a paper in Chinese saying that her motive to visit the US is not in compliance with visa regulation." They added, "the whole interview took less than three minutes. The officer just saw the passport and invitation letter, and rejected her." As well as Yang, her design assistant, her p.r. assistant, a translator and her VIP guests were also refused visas. Since Yang has had no problems getting visas for the other global fashion capitals - London, Paris and Milan - the team suspects that the bad blood between the US and China could be to blame. "Under the current relationship between Trump and China, she feels that it has impacted her business and [she's] being a victim of this trade-war drama." They added, "If the USA is not welcoming international visitors coming for business anymore, then we will sure find other more accommodating places to show the collection." The show will go on without Yang, who has entrusted proceedings to her fashion consultant from Milan, Meng Ji, and Kelly Cutrone of People's Revolution. It's scheduled for Sept. 6 at Spring Studios. An official from US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it "does not comment on individual cases." The State Department also declined to comment.

  2020 watch: Dems Memory-Hole Their Records 
  "Rarely have we seen an entire primary field of candidates scrambling to renounce all their past identities and agendas - and to do so unapologetically, abruptly and vehemently," National Review's Victor Davis Hanson writes of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Apparently, all of the candidates believe that the way to the top is to take back everything they once said they believed in when it comes to issues like immigration and law and order. The walk-backs by the likes of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are often "quite stunning," says Hanson. They and the others seem to think that "no one will remember what they once promoted anyway" and that "everyone will give them a pass when, if nominated, they run in the general election on some of what they just renounced in primaries." 
  Conservative: Slavery Broke America's Promise 
  The New York Times' "1619 Project" attempts to chronicle America's past through the "history, legacy and modern ramifications of slavery," The Washington Examiner's Philip Klein notes. But one undiscussed ramification is "the extent to which the legacy of slavery effectively made it impossible to limit the size and scope of the federal government." Although "apologists for the Confederacy" argue that the Civil War was fought over states' rights rather than slavery, this claim is a "pernicious myth" that southerners adopted to excuse their pro-slavery and pro-segregation views. They thus forever tainted the doctrine of states' rights and limited government - a setback conservatives and limited-government advocates are forced to grapple with in 2019. 
  Urban beat: Where Has Frisco's Money Gone? 
  San Francisco's budget skyrocketed to $12.2 billion in 2019, up from $8.6 billion in 2009. The worst part: "San Francisco has squandered its fortune," ­reports Phillip Sprincin in the City Journal. There's a severe housing shortage, a subway system that remains unopened and a train station that serves no trains. So what has Frisco's government done with the money? "Municipal employment has eaten up a large share," with 45 percent of the budget accounting for salaries and benefits. Add "political indifference and bureaucratic mismanagement," plus ill-conceived infrastructure projects, and you end up with such colossal waste. Sprincin concludes: "Given how little the city has done with its incredible windfall, year after year, it's not clear what it values at all." 
  Econ desk: Watch Out for the (Warren) Crash 
  Sen. Liz Warren thinks she sees another economic crash around the corner. Yet her own terrible ideas are the biggest threat to growth, snarks Andy Puzder in The Washington Post. For starters, her doom-and-gloom stance "is so 2016." If Warren would look at recent numbers, she would see that "in President Donald Trump's first two years, employee compensation increased by $672 billion more than it did during President Barack Obama's last two, for a whopping 42 percent improvement." Thanks to the president's "tax cuts and deregulation, Americans' incomes have increased dramatically, while costs - reflected in the low inflation rate - have gone up quite modestly." Meanwhile, Warren's platform, including "free - meaning government-funded - child care, early education and college tuition" and the like, might as well be titled "The Current Economic Boom - and How to Kill It." 
  Iconoclast: Dems Need To Wake Up on Russia 
  Why did the data site FiveThirtyEight decide to avoid Russia when it surveyed the Democratic presidential candidates for "their views on key foreign policy issues?" asks Bloomberg's Leonid Bershidsky. FiveThirtyEight claimed "it couldn't formulate a provocative question," but that doesn't wash for Bershidsky. The problem, he says, may be that because "of a kind of Pavlovian reflex" that was "formed in American political circles since 2016," FiveThirtyEight realized it wouldn't get answers outside of an "associative chain" that "immediately drags up 'Russian election interference' and 'Trump is a Putin stooge.' " While there are serious issues with Russia that any post-Trump administration would need to confront, including in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, Democrats remain mired in "unrealistic expectations from the Mueller investigation" and "hacking and propaganda" - none of which is "near the top of the list" of actual Kremlin-related foreign challenges.

   President Trump insisted Wednesday he's no puppet of the National Rifle Association. 
  "They are Trump talking points," he said when a reporter asked if he was parroting NRA talking points by moving away from supporting universal background checks. 
  He insisted that a chat with NRA chief Wayne LaPierre (inset) didn't compel him to distance himself from supporting a future bill on background checks. 
  "Oh, I have an appetite for background checks," Trump said on the White House's South Lawn. "We're working with Democrats, we're working with Republicans. We already have very strong background checks, but we are going to be filling in some of the loopholes, as we call them, at the border." 
  The president then segued to talking about immigration policy before being asked if LaPierre pressed him not to pursue background checks when they spoke by phone Tuesday. 
  "No, I didn't say anything about that," Trump responded. "We had a great talk with Wayne yesterday. Didn't say anything about that, just talked about concepts." 
  Trump claimed that the NRA backs closing gun-purchase loopholes. 
  "Wayne agrees things have to be done also," Trump added. 
  The NRA refused on Wednesday to back up or refute Trump's comments.  
  "The NRA has a longstanding policy about not discussing private conversations with the press," spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told The Post. 
   Arulanandam wouldn't articulate the NRA's current position on background checks.  
  The Atlantic previously described an Aug. 7 conversation between the two men, in which Trump asked LaPierre if the NRA would budge, at all, on background checks.  
  "No," LaPierre answered, according to the report..  
  In the direct aftermath of the double mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, the president said the country needed "very meaningful background checks." 
  He didn't go as far in the Oval Office on Tuesday. 
  While Trump rebuffed the idea that he was being influenced by the NRA, he voiced concerns often raised by gun enthusiasts. 
  "I'm concerned that no matter what we agree to, when we get there, the Democrats will say, 'Oh, well, we now want this' . . . it's a slippery slope," the president said.

  Mayor de Blasio is opening the door for more illegal immigrants to live in the city's ­affordable apartments - and will also let ­additional people cram their way into each unit, under new rules announced Wednesday. 
  Hizzoner's unilateral decrees, which went into effect on Tuesday, are part of a package of changes intended to expand access to the highly-sought-after housing, which is distributed by lottery. 
  Under the new rules, tenants who sign the leases for the apartments will still have to produce proof of legal employment. But other adults will no longer have to produce proof they have a Social Security number or a federal Individual Taxpayer Identification number in order to move in. 
  That means extended family members, significant others and people who are "financially interdependent" with the renters can fill up apartments in all five boroughs, regardless of whether they're in the country legally. 
  "These new changes are a step towards promoting greater racial equity in our housing market and greater access to affordable housing, regardless of immigration status," said Bitta Mostofi, who runs the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs. 
  Other amendments to the affordable-housing rules increase by one the number of people who can live in each apartment, raising the maximum capacity of studios and one-bedroom units to two and three people, respectively. Five people will now be allowed in a two-bedroom apartment and up to seven we be allowed to live in a three-bedroom pad. 
  De Blasio also lifted a requirement that ­affordable-housing applicants undergo credit checks.  
  Instead, the rules will allow let tenants to submit receipts, canceled checks or other documents showing that they paid their rent on time during the previous 12 months. 
  City Councilman Eric Ulrich (R-Queens) called eliminating the mandatory credit checks "just the latest idiotic idea to come out of this administration." 
   "The mayor is setting up people to fail and is doing a disservice to New Yorkers who desperately need affordable housing," Ulrich said.

Gaffe-riot Joe coasting Biden now up by 14 as Harris tanks

  Joe Biden's lead rose among Democratic presidential contenders while Kamala Harris sank like a stone in a new poll released Tuesday, which also showed the other top four candidates essentially treading water. 
  The former veep - despite a series of characteristic gaffes in recent weeks - was the choice of 29 percent of those surveyed by CNN between Thursday and Sunday, up from 22 percent in a June survey by the cable network. 
  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was quick to mock Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, for her falling numbers on Twitter, suggesting that Democrats were "racist and sexist" for not supporting her. 
   "Kamala Harris plummeted 12 points from June to August, according to a new @CNN #poll of Democrats about 2020. Using their own logic and lexicon, doesn't that make Democrat primary voters 'racist' and 'sexist'?" she wrote. 
  Team Trump has responded to charges of racism against the president over his immigration policies and attacks on a handful of minority lawmakers by accusing Democrats of branding anyone who disagrees with their policies as racists. 
  Harris, the California senator whose numbers rose after the first presidential debate, fell back to earth, garnering just 5 percent in the new poll compared to 17 percent in June. 
  The poll also showed that Bernie Sanders rose to 15 percent from 14 percent; Elizabeth Warren dropped from 15 percent to 14 percent; and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg rose a point to 5 percent. 
  None of the other candidates, including Beto O'Rourke, Julian Castro or Cory Booker, topped 3 percent. 
  New York's entrants in the crowded field, Mayor de Blasio and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, each failed to crack 1 percent. 
  Biden's jump in the poll comes as Democrats worry about his uneven performance in the debates and on the campaign trail, including a statement that suggested that minority children could be as smart as white children. 
  Harris' post-debate surge came after she schooled Biden for his opposition to busing, leaving him flat-footed and without an effective comeback. 
  His staffers insist the gaffes are not a big problem and are just "Joe being Joe." 
  According to CNN, the sample of 1,001 voters included 28 percent who described themselves as Democrats, 26 percent who described themselves as Republicans and 46 percent who described themselves as independents or members of another party. 
  Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For the sub-sample of 402 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who are registered to vote and were asked about the primary candidates, it is 6.1 points. 
  Poll positions 
  June 28-30 Aug. 15-18 Change

  Mexico is sending some of the 30,000 Central American migrants vying for asylum in the United States on 750-mile bus rides - all the way back to southern Mexico, officials said. 
  The "Remain in Mexico" program pushed by the Trump administration has forced thousands of asylum seekers back to Mexico to wait months to get their turn before a US immigration judge. 
  But the northern state of Tamaulipas, across the Rio Grande from Texas, is one of Mexico's most dangerous zones . Officials did not say how the asylum seekers will make their way back to the border for their court dates.

  Last-minute summer book guide 
  MCNALLY JACKSON  
  After making a splash in the UK, 28-year-old Irish writer Sally Rooney is now a sensation in New York. Her two novels, "Conversations with Friends" and "Normal People" (Hogarth) both explore modern, coming-of-age love affairs, and were recommended by almost every bookseller on this list.  
  "They go down like milkshakes, super fast. Super easy," says Sam MacLaughin, a bookseller at McNally Jackson, which has locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Her stories are "not without their darkness but still very enjoyable."  
  Another perfect summer read is Jenny Odell's "How to do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy" (Melville House), claims MacLaughin, who says it "articulated a lot of vague feelings I'd been having about the Internet and looking at my phone too much - and brought clarity and resolve to my thinking about them (and everything else I've been missing)." 
  BOOKS ARE MAGIC 
  Ocean Vuong's debut novel "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" (Penguin) is flying off the shelves at Brooklyn's Books are Magic, making it one of the store's top picks for summer. Written in the form of a letter to the narrator's mother, the book takes the reader through the nuances of parental relationships, assimilating to America and the challenges of being gay. "It's the kind of book that will make you stay inside reading for hours and hours because it's so deeply pleasurable," said store owner Emma Straub. 
   Taffy Brodesser-Akner's first novel "Fleishman Is in Trouble" (Random House) is another popular pick. "It's sort of about divorce, but it's about friendship and love and getting older," Straub said. "I guess it's like a divorce rom-com but really also profoundly deep and moving and will also make you cry." 
  THE CORNER BOOKSTORE 
  Peter Orner's "Maggie Brown & Others" (Little, Brown) - a collection of 44 interconnected short stories - gets a big thumbs-up from The Corner Bookstore on Madison Avenue. Loosely bound by geography, the "very short" stories are anchored by a novella about a 40-year marriage and a whole era in a New England town, "and it's really fantastic," said Chris Lenahan, store buyer and manager.  
  History buffs, meanwhile, should pick up "The British are Coming: The War for America, Lexington to Princeton, 1775-1777" (Henry Holt) by Pulitzer-winning Rick Atkinson. Packed with powerful portraits of characters like Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, Atkinson's expert storytelling gives the book a widespread appeal. "I actually don't love military history, but the way he writes it's almost like you're right there," Lenahan said.  
  BOOK CULTURE 
  "Underland: A Deep Time Journey" (W. W. Norton), which plunges readers into the darkest underworlds on Earth and into the future, is selling well with customers at Book Culture's four locations in the city. 
  Robert Macfarlane's sequel to his bestseller, "The Old Ways," "'Underland' is a cool nonfiction book that we're really able to sell," said general manager Nick Buzanski. 
  Another nonfiction pick is Michael Bobelian's "Battle For The Marble Palace: Abe Fortas, Earl Warren, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and the Forging of the Modern Supreme Court" (Schaffner Press). The book focuses on America in 1968 and the nomination of Abe Fortas for chief justice of the Supreme Court - at a time when the country was roiled by culture wars. Great for anyone seeking more substance from their summer reading. 
  MYSTERIOUS BOOKSHOP 
  Juliet Grames' debut novel, "The Seven or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortun a" (Ecco) gets the nod from The Mysterious Bookshop on Warren Street. Following the life of a young girl who believes she is cursed and her journey with her family from Italy to the United States, "it's a multi-generational immigration story [with] a fascinating female protagonist," said Mysterious Bookshop manager Thomas Wickersham. "Even if the time that she's talking about is decades ago, it couldn't be more relevant now."  
  Meanwhile, Mona Awad's "darkly funny" novel "Bunny" - about a scholarship girl who feels like an outsider in an MFA program filled with mean-girl cliques - is a great summer thriller. "She's a very sharp writer and takes some unexpected turns," said Wickersham. "It keeps you in susp ense."

It'll take skill Trump's immigration plan gives preference to educated & talented

  President Trump on Thursday unveiled a sweeping immigration-reform plan that would favor people with top educations and valuable skills - and sharply limit those admitted at random or solely because they have family in the United States. 
  "We're here on this very beautiful spring day in the Rose Garden to unveil our plan to create a fair, modern and lawful system of immigration for the United States, and it is about time," Trump said, again arguing that the nation's immigration system is broken and needs to be overhauled. 
  "Our plan achieves two critical goals. First, it stops illegal immigration and fully secures the border, and second, it establishes a new legal immigration system that protects American wages, promotes American values, and attracts the best and brightest from all around the world," the president continued in an unusually low-key address. 
  Currently, 66 percent of green cards are issued to immigrants with family ties to the US and only 12 percent are given to people based on their skills. 
  Under the new plan, 57 percent would be awarded what Trump called "Build America Visas" based on merit. 
  "Only 12 percent of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit. In countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand and others, that number is closer to 60 and even 70 and 75 percent in some cases," he said. 
  "Under the senseless rules of the current system, we're not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world," he said. 
  "We discriminate against brilliance. We won't anymore once we get this passed." 
  Factors such as age, English-language ability and employment offers would also be taken into account. 
  The diversity visa lottery, which offers green cards to citizens of countries with historically low rates of immigration to the US, would be eliminated. 
  "Twenty-one percent of immigrants are issued [visas] either by random lottery or because they're fortunate enough to be selected for humanitarian relief," Trump said. 
   "Random selection is contrary to American values and blocks out many qualified potential immigrants from around the world who have much to contribute." 
  The US would also strengthen ports of entry to ensure all vehicles and people are screened and create a self-sustaining fund, paid for with increased fees, to maintain and modernize ports of entry and new border walls in targeted locations. 
  The commander in chief also claimed that many of the asylum seekers from Central America who are flooding across the southern border are making bogus claims. 
  "Unfortunately, legitimate asylum seekers are being replaced by those lodging frivolous claims - these are frivolous claims to gain admission into our country," he said.  
  The president also said that the White House plan would not discriminate against any individuals. 
  "No matter where in the world you're born, no matter who your relatives are, if you want to become an American citizen, it will be clear exactly what standard we ask you to achieve," he said. 
  But he acknowledged that the plan could face an uphill fight in a divided Congress - but predicted it would ultimately pass if the GOP regains control of the House. 
  No notable Democrats were present for Trump's speech. The attendees included key Republican lawmakers and Iowa Rep. Steven King, an immigration hard-liner who was censured by the House last year for remarks about white supremacy.  
  "If for some reason, possibly political, we can't get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we'll get it approved immediately after the election when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency," he said, a line that prompted a standing ovation. 
  The latest effort was spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, but Trump said law-enforcement experts also had a large say. 
   "It was designed with significant input from our great law-enforcement professionals, to detail what they need to make our border . . . 100 percent operationally secure," he said.  
   Efforts to overhaul the immigration system have gone nowhere for three decades because of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats on the ­hot-button issue. 
  And prospects for an agreement seem bleak as the 2020 elections near, though the plan could give Trump and the GOP a proposal to rally behind, even if talks with Democrats go nowhere. 
  The plan does not address what to do about the millions of immigrants already living in the country illegally, including hundreds of thousands of young "Dreamers" brought to the US as children - a top priority for Democrats. 
   Nor does it reduce overall rates of immigration, as many conservative Republicans would like to see. 
  "I don't think it's designed to get Democratic support as much as it is to unify the Republican Party around border security, a negotiating position," said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a close Trump ally. 
  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the White House for failing to engage in talks with Democrats over the latest proposal. 
  "Don't come up with a plan that Stephen Miller rubber-stamps and say, 'Now, pass it.' It's not going to happen," Schumer said, referring to Trump's hard-line policy adviser. 
  But Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration rates, applauded Trump's plan as a "very positive effort."  
  With  AP 
  Highlights of the immigrationreform plan unveiled Thursday by President Trump: 
  n Far fewer green cards would be given to people with relatives already in the United States. Currently, 66 percent go to immigrants with family here. 
  n 57 percent of green cards versus the current 12 percent would be based on merit with the creation of Build America Visas. 
  n Factors such as age, English-language proficiency and employment offers would also be taken into account. 
  n The diversity visa lottery, which offers green cards to citizens of countries with historically low rates of immigration to the US, would be eliminated. 
  n The US would strengthen ports of entry to ensure all vehicles and people are screened. 
  n A self-sustaining fund, paid for with increased fees, would be created to modernize ports of entry. 
  n A border wall would be built in targeted locations. 
  n The number of asylum seekers allowed into the US would be reduced. 
  n The plan does not address what to do about the millions of immigrants already living in the country illegally, including hundreds of thousands of young "Dreamers" brought to the US as children - a priority for Democrats.

'Green' screen Feds to deny cards to immigs on aid

   The Trump administration unveiled a rule change on Monday that will  give federal officials  more leeway to deny green cards to immigrants considered likely to rely on government aid like food stamps, housing assistance or Medicaid. 
  "We want to see people coming to this country who are self-sufficient," Ken Cuccinelli (inset), acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, said at the White House. "That's a core principle of the American  d ream. It's deeply embedded in our history, and particularly our history related to legal immigration."  
  The rule will go into effect  Oct. 15 and will  expand the definition of "public charge," which Congress first approved in 1882 to ensure immigrants are self-sufficient. 
  The new rule will define a "public charge" as someone who receives one or more benefits for more than 12 months in a 36-month period and who needs a wide range of public assistance, including Medicaid, housing vouchers or help buying food through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  
  It updates guidelines, on the books since 1999, that defined the term as someone who is "primarily dependent" on the government and who received cash benefits, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income from Social Security. 
  Cuccinelli said the change will affect about 400,000 people a year "whose application to become a legal permanent resident will include a meaningful analysis whether or not they are likely to become a public charge or not."  
   Along with the benefits assessment, government officials also would review an applicant's age, health, family status, financial resources and ability to communicate in English. 
  "Through the public charge rule, the Trump administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America," Cuccinelli said.  
  Throughout US history, "Americans and legal immigrants have pulled themselves by their bootstraps to pursue their dreams and the opportunity of this great nation," he added.  
  Cuccinelli also said the rule will have the "long-term benefit "  of protecting taxpayers by ensuring the immigrants "don't become public ­burdens." 
  President Trump is delivering on his promise to "uphold the rule of law" and "promoting our shared history and encouraging the core values needed to make the American dream a reality," Cuccinelli said.  
   A number of immigrant advocacy groups said they will sue to block the new rule because it discriminates against low-income applicants.

Taking Liberty's with new immig policy

  The acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services on Tuesday added his own take to the "huddled masses" poem at the Statue of Liberty to include accepting migrants who can "stand on their own two feet."  
  Ken Cuccinelli was responding to a question about whether the Trump administration's updated requirements for getting a green card were in the spirit of Emma Lazarus' poem, "The New Colossus." 
  "Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge," Cuccinelli said on NPR's "Morning Edition."  
  Cuccinelli on Monday announced the rule change that redefines a "public charge" as an immigrant who is likely to end up receiving some kind of public assistance, including Medicaid, housing vouchers and food stamps. 
  Asked about Cuccinelli's comments, President Trump said it conforms with his "America First" policy. 
  "I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer paying for people to come into the United States," the president said. 
  "So what we've done is institute what took place many, many years ago - at our founding, virtually. But we are just reinstituting it. And I think it's long overdue," he said, referring to the "public charge" term that Congress initially approved in 1882 to ensure immigrants are self-sufficient. 
  NPR's Rachel Martin asked Cuccinelli if the new rule, which takes effect Oct. 15, jibes with the democratic ideal of the American dream. Cuccinelli said it does not alter what makes America "exceptional." 
  On CNN later, Cuccinelli claimed Lazarus' poem referred specifically to migrants "from Europe." Actually, it speaks of "world-wide welcome."

  Dozens of "ABOLISH ICE" protesters lined up to be arrested Saturday after blocking traffic on the West Side Highway, just yards from one of the agency's New York offices. 
  Cars traveling in both directions came to a halt shortly after 1 p.m., when demonstrators protesting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement marched onto the highway at West 26th Street.  
  The crowd chanted "I believe that we will win," and "Reunite the families" as they rallied in the street. They were later joined by a marching band.  
  Approximately 100 people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for blocking traffic, according to police.  
  "We're pretty happy about [the arrests]," said activist Miriam Bernstein, 32. "That was the goal. People volunteered specifically to be arrested . . . We were disrupting traffic to raise awareness and get some support."  
  Katia Perea, a CUNY sociology professor, added: "Civil disobedience shows that we aren't violent. In fact, we don't support violence."  
  Video posted to Twitter by user Victor Amos shows dozens of people in the middle of the intersection as authorities can be heard over a loudspeaker urging them to move. 
  Other social media photos show protestors with a sign that read, "ABOLISH ICE."

Brain-Dead 'Backlash' Stephen Ross is a solid liberal

  In America, people are free to support candidates of their choice. They're also free to boycott companies they don't like. 
  And, as the matter of real-estate mogul Stephen Ross and President Trump reminds us, they're also free to be stupid. 
  Only dead brains can explain the overblown "backlash" over a Ross-hosted Trump fundraiser in the Hamptons. Despite over-the-top media coverage, it's a few noisy guys on a street corner by today's jungle-law standards.  
  It consists of a few cranky Equinox and SoulCycle fitness-club members calling for a boycott, one Miami Dolphins wide receiver and chefs David Chang and José Andres. 
  Ross' Related Companies owns the health clubs, the NFL Dolphins and the Hudson Yards mall where Andres' Mercado Little Spain food hall is a tenant. Ross also invests in Chang's Momofuku eatery empire. 
  Andres ("a good man," he says of Ross) and Chang didn't call for Ross' head - they just begged him to drop the fundraiser. Chang said that Ross' support for Trump "contradicts what I hoped to accomplish before taking your money in the first place." Well, if Chang is so disgusted, he should make his point by giving the money back to Ross. 
  At least the chefs were polite, unlike minor comedian Billy Eichner, who boldly and bravely said he canceled his Equinox membership over Ross' enabling of "racism and mass murder." 
  Temperate or insane, they picked on the wrong guy. Equinox and SoulCycle employees, who owe Ross their livelihoods (and thanks for creating the first-ever Equinox Hotel at Hudson Yards), need some serious shaming for scrambling to distance themselves from a Hamptons lunch to which they weren't invited. 
  Ross, a friend of Trump for 40 years, embraces more of the orthodox liberal social agenda than just about any multibillionaire real-estate mogul. He's positively woke on some positions, which must drive Trump crazy. 
  But for Trump-hating absolutists, anyone who offers him aid or comfort of any sort is to be excommunicated from the world of respectable society and discourse. 
  Idiots might think Ross, on some level, acquiesces in Trump's toxic views on immigration, economic inequality, the environment and other hot-button topics. Or that he's on board with Trump's venomous way with words on Twitter. 
  Fact: Related Cos. is the most prolific private-sector creator of affordable housing in the country - not just lately but since the 1970s. 
  Sure, Related built a relative handful of super-luxury condos at Time Warner Center and Hudson Yards. But it built and owns many, many more rental apartments in the United States - at least 70,000 - and of them, more than 70 percent operate and are rented under one or more local affordable-housing programs. 
  Ross personally donated hundreds of millions of dollars to the University of Michigan (his alma mater) and NYU, neither of which is to be mistaken for right-wing Bob Jones University. 
  He's a director of the World Resources Institute, which supports environmental sustainability and seeks to address climate change. He founded the nonprofit Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality, which champions social justice and aims to eliminate racial discrimination. 
  I've covered Ross, a rare gentleman in an ungentlemanly business, for years. His principled, nuanced positions on social and economic issues - the kind we once called "humane" before everything in America was politicized by left and right alike - are anything but Trumpian. 
  Why would he help Trump raise a few bucks? It's a complicated world out there, folks. Maybe Ross - a developer with fortunes at stake every time his company lifts a shovel - would rather back a traditional, centrist Democrat who didn't regard capitalism as a form of original sin. Too bad no such candidate exists in a field of far-left socialists and gaffe-prone bumblers with no chance to win. 
  Let the haters have their moment. I'll bet that Equinox survives the purge.

IMMIGRATION CRISIS Council borders on insanity: pol

  A Democratic lawmaker from Queens quit the City Council committee overseeing immigration because it is so far to the left that members wouldn't meet with federal officials.  
  "I've been asking for this for some time because it's all one-sided," Councilman Robert Holden said of his request for reassignment, which was granted Tuesday.  
  "The agenda is already set, and I could never get anything on it," he added, including setting up a meeting with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. 
  Holden (pictured) said he's had to be meet alone with ICE personnel at their lower Manhattan offices because he "could not get any other council member to go with me . . . like it's a bad thing." 
  The intransigence left Holden baffled. 
  "Why is it?" he asked. "They're law enforcement. They're saving us from . . . bad people who should not be in this country. So why wouldn't we invite them to an immigration hearing to at least hear their side?" 
  Holden also charged that the seven-member committee "doesn't get anything done," saying it's focused on fringe issues like a nonbinding resolution calling on the state to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses. 
  Councilman Carlos Menchaca, the panel's chair, responded to Holden by saying the committee is on the side of immigrants. 
  "I'm very proud of the work that this committee is doing, and we will continue to fight for the rights of all immigrants," the Brooklyn Democrat said. 
  He didn't deny the committee's boycott of ICE. 
  Holden's comments came hours before a contentious meeting in which the council approved new committee assignments, including removing Councilman Kalmen Yeger (D-Brooklyn) from the same Committee on Immigration. 
  Yeger was being punished for tweeting "Palestine does not exist" last month - remarks Council Speaker Corey Johnson and many other legislators said were "divisive." 
  Johnson defended the decision to replace Yeger. 
  "We want a committee that all immigrants feel welcome when they come and testify, and so that was how this decision was made," he said. "One of the things that I find disappointing is that he hasn't acknowledged how hurtful this is." 
   Tuesday's meeting also featured a heated debate over freedom of speech. 
  "I want to make it clear that I do not agree with Councilmember Yeger's comments . . . but I don't believe censorship should be a tool that this institution could utilize against First Amendment rights," said Councilman Mark Gjonaj (D-Bronx), who still supported the committee changes. 
  Bronx Councilman Ruben Diaz Sr., whose for-hire vehicles committee was dissolved in February after he claimed the legislative body is "controlled" by gays, was vociferous on the free-speech issue. 
  "This City Council keeps on taking away people's right to speak," Diaz said. "We got to stop trying to quiet people. This is wrong! This is wrong! This is wrong!"

  In the wake of two horrific mass shootings, President Trump on Monday offered welcome words and a few useful starting points to address the madness. But he - and all of Washington - have a long way to go. 
  Americans are "outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil," said Trump. "Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives." 
  Citing the El Paso gunman's "racist" manifesto, he called on Americans to "condemn racism, bigotry and white nationalism" - "sinister ideologies" that must be "defeated." 
  Finally, Trump warned that Americans can't let themselves feel "powerless." 
  "We can and will stop this evil contagion," he said, then offered specifics: 
  * He ordered the Justice Department to work with other agencies and social-media companies to "develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike." 
  * He repeated his calls for red-flag laws, which allow judges, after "rapid due process," to bar dangerously troubled individuals from possessing firearms. The Parkland high-school shooter, he noted, had raised many red flags, yet no one acted. 
  * He called for "reform" of mental-health laws "to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence" and get them treated and, when necessary, involuntarily confined. 
  Plus, Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) met with the president and say he "showed a willingness to work with us" to toughen up background checks. 
   Trouble is, Trump's tone-deaf follow-up tweet linked passage of new background-check laws to his pet subject, immigration: 
  "Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying . . .sthis legislation with desperately needed immigration reform. We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!" 
  Huh? Immigration reform has absolutely nothing to do with mass shootings, and the president's linkage makes it sound like he'd agree to one only if he got the other. Worse, some might even think he's somehow justifying the lunacy of the El Paso wacko, who lashed out at immigrants in his manifesto and waged his attack at a place near the Mexican border where immigrants shop. 
   Also disappointing: Trump said nothing about the broader gun-control issue - specifically, for example, passing a new and better assault-weapons ban. 
  "Mental illness pulls the trigger, not the gun," he asserted. Yet unless high-powered weapons are made significantly harder to get, there will still be triggers around for the mentally ill to pull. 
  To those who say any new gun laws are an infringement on the Second Amendment: Our nation gives citizens the right to bear arms. But it does not, and it should not, give them the right to become an arsenal. This isn't about handguns, it's about weapons of war.  
  Trump is right that Americans are not "powerless" in the face of ongoing gun violence. Yet, as president, he has more power than anyone. He needs to use it.

  Conservative: Trump Isn't Fueling Hate 
  "There are plenty of reasons not to blame [President] Trump for last weekend's slaughter," argues Toby Young in The Spectator. For starters, the killer in El Paso, Texas, "railed against climate change . . . and the president is a climate change skeptic." The Dayton shooter "was a self-described 'leftist' who praised Elizabeth Warren." Nor is it the case that hate crimes are on the rise under Trump. As the Bureau of Justice Statistics noted last year, while "reported hate crimes increased from 104,400 to 107,900 between 2016 and 2017, unreported hate crimes fell from 92,100 to 86,900, meaning the total number actually fell in the first year of Trump's presidency." Bottom line: "It's incredibly hard to show that inflammatory rhetoric, whether on the right or the left, causes violent crime." 
  Libertarian: The Folly of Criminalizing 'Domestic Terror' 
  A "growing chorus" may be "demanding stronger laws targeting politically motivated violence" after the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. But making domestic terrorism a federal crime is a "very bad idea that's bound to threaten liberty more than it hampers terrorists," warns J.D. Tuccille in Reason. Some of the push for this move comes from "rent-seekers," like the FBI Agents Association, "a labor union representing law-enforcement agents who would gain another law to enforce." But it isn't clear whether "there's any need to pass more laws . . . Murder and ­related forms of mayhem are already illegal in every state, and there's no reason to believe that the federal government is better prepared to prosecute crimes than state and local authorities." 
  Liberal: Hey, Dems - Don't Jump Off the Cliff 
  The Democrats' debates on CNN were "the political version of 'The Bachelorette' - and just as painful to watch," grouses Peter Penn in The Hill. The cable networks "want gladiator TV," and "the candidates have taken the bait" and "set their sights on each other." They have even criticized former President Barack Obama, "a man with a popularity rating greater than 90 percent among Democrats in virtually every poll." And their proposals, like abolishing private insurance, taxing the middle class, free college and decriminalizing ­illegal immigration, are losers. In pushing such plans, Democrats risk "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." 
  Economist: No, Trump's Tariffs Won't Steal Christmas 
  Slamming a Washington Post business story that claimed President Trump's latest China tariffs would push toy prices up 17 percent and laptops by $120, Spencer Morrison explains at American Greatness that Trump won't "ruin Christmas, and the price of toys will not rise perceptibly. Why? Because tariffs don't work like sales taxes." Pundits made the same mistake about the president's 40 percent tariffs on washing ­machines imposed early in 2018, yet the "laundry equipment" component of the Consumer Price Index - based on actual store prices - is up only mildly above other inflation. Why? "Tariffs are levied on the first sale price - the price paid to foreign vendors by American companies or their middlemen," which is only a part of the final price for consumers. So a 10 percent tariff can mean you pay just 1 percent more. Also, "you can avoid paying tariffs entirely by buying American." 
  Culture critic: A Pause Before You Post  
  Imagine creating an online post, pressing a button to post it and then having to wait before it goes live. That, suggests Jonathan Rauch at The Atlantic, could give people a chance to think twice before posting something they will regret and give social-media companies a chance to vet the content. The pause could be 10 minutes, an hour or "user-selected." But during that time, "something might happen": Users might get a warning that a claim in the post is "disputed by leading fact-checkers." They may be asked, "Are you sure you're ready to share this with the world? ­Remember, it will be out there forever." And platforms like Facebook and YouTube might be able to block, say, "snuff" videos in advance. Slowing down, concludes Rauch, "would help us put our better selves forward, perhaps often enough to make social media more sociable."

The Issue: The lack of media coverage of the left-leaning politics of accused Dayton shooter Connor Betts.  
  To his critics, every statement by President Trump is racist, even though not a word of his ever has been. And if a mass killer is on the right, Trump must have incentivized him ("Crazy has no party," Aug. 7).  
  Yet alleged Dayton killer Connor Betts appeared to have a history of pro-leftist views - including hatred for ICE agents and support for Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The media glosses over that, and conveniently fails to mention the politicians' names.  
  A local news station in New York tweaked Betts' history to avoid calling him a leftist or supporter of Democrat causes. In New York City, they can get away with that, but nationally, people are fed up. Come 2020, they will be heard.   
  John Brindisi,    Manhattan 
  A few days after running a shockingly responsible plea to ban weapons of war, The Post ran a column entitled "Antifa's First Mass Killer?" (Andy Ngo, PostOpinion, Aug. 7). 
  At this point, there is not a scintilla of evidence that the alleged killer was carrying out an anti-fascist crusade. The suspect shot his sister and best friend and random revelers. Where were the fascists?  
  The alleged killer in El Paso was gunning down Mexican-looking "invaders" consistent with his white-supremacist beliefs.  
  I know the conservative media is desperate to make the antifa clowns into mass murderers, but you can do better than this.  
  John Moncrief,  Fanwood, NJ 
  Ngo is correct that while the attacks are similar, the response from liberals and leftists has been anything but. 
  And Ngo demonstrated this by his own experience: When he got beaten up by antifa thugs in Portland, I don't recall a peep from liberals and leftists.  
  David Tulanian,  Las Vegas, Nev. 
  There were two mass shootings about 12 hours apart, and Democrats and their allies only became hysterical about one.  
  They jumped all over the El Paso killer, whose white-supremacist beliefs allowed Democrats to bizarrely link him to the president.  
  The Dayton killer, on the other hand, was an antifa and Warren supporter, and therefore served no useful political purpose to the demagogues.  
  Linking Trump to the killings of over 20 innocents in El Paso gives them something to run on in 2020. It also shows what happens to a party when it loses its moral compass and any sense of decency.  
  Steve Heitner,  Port Jefferson Station 
  It's obvious that the accused Dayton shooter's motives had nothing to do with his political ideology.  
  And it's clear that the right-wing madman who allegedly massacred almost two dozen innocents in El Paso was driven solely by his hatred for immigrants in general, and Mexicans in particular, and was almost certainly influenced by Trump's vile rhetoric. 
   Anne Stockton,  Manhattan 
  Leftists and newspapers focused on Patrick Crusius as a supporter of Trump, but Betts was an avid fan of Warren.  
  And neither is relevant to the horrible actions that the shooters committed. They were both sick, demented people. Period.  
  Ralph Miano,  Naples, Fla. 
  I can just imagine what is going on behind the scenes in the Warren and Sanders camps. They're probably asking: What do we do about the accused Dayton shooter? What do we say?  
  Unlike the El Paso shooter, he was a leftist. He was an anti-Trump, pro-illegal immigration, antifa-loving socialist.  
  But, of course, there is a solution: Say and do nothing. Since he was a leftist, the mainstream media will forget all about him. In fact, I don't even remember his name. See? Problem solved.   
  Bret Wallach,  Glen Cove 
  If only the liberal media weren't so obvious. About 99 percent of the heated coverage was over El Paso, and 1 percent was on Dayton. The reason? After very little digging, it became known that the accused Dayton maniac was a leftist.  
  He was a screwball, devoted to Warren and Sanders, who had voted in Democratic primaries.  
  But why let a few relevant facts spoil an opportunity for the nation's leftists, who are so consumed with hate for Trump?  
  Myron Hecker,  New City

  Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are caught trying to enter the US every year from more than 100 countries - from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, according to Homeland Security data. 
  The overwhelming majority comes from Mexico and passes through the southern US border, though that number has declined sharply between fiscal years 2008 and 2018. 
  But while Mexican detentions are down, apprehensions of immigrants from Honduras and Guatemala - many of them families seeking asylum in the US - have soared. 
  And though small in number, illegal immigrants have been caught from a number of eyebrow-raising countries, including North Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. 
  In 2018, 152,257 Mexican citizens were nabbed at the southern border, up from 127,938 in 2017 but fewer than the 653,035 in 2008. The number from Guatemala jumped from 66,871 to 115,722 in the same period. 
  And apprehensions of Honduran citizens spiked from 47,260 to 76,513. 
  The numbers aren't shocking, Manhattan immigration attorney Yaniv Lavy told The Post. "It's not surprising, people love this country and they want to come here, Lavy said. "Unfortunately if they can't come here legally, they'll do it illegally."

  Culture critic: From El Paso and Dayton to . . . Rwanda 
  "At first glance," Lance Morrow admits at City Journal, "the killings in El Paso and Dayton appear entirely different from such foreign horror" as the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and the Serbian mass murder of Muslims in 1992. Yet he sees "an inkling in" US mass shootings "of something ominously new in the way of American violence." That "something" - still yet just a "whiff or germ or intuition of a new infection" - will make the 2020 campaigns "turn mainly on race, racism and immigration." With each side blind to its own faults, "the Democrats' obsession with identity politics has colluded with Trump's provocations to split Americans into polarized tribes," and "whoever wins, the divisions will remain and probably grow worse."  
  Conservative: The Rot in Our Ruling Class 
  At First Things, R.R. Reno warns that America's mass shootings "are symptoms of a sick body politic." White-nationalist ideology and the easy availability of high-powered guns are part of the "danger," but "neither explanation goes deep enough": Both were present two generations ago, yet we suffered nothing like today's epidemic. The deeper cause, Reno ­argues, is "the social decomposition of the United States," also evidenced by the opioid crisis, growing urban homelessness, rising out-of-wedlock births and working-class Americans' falling life expectancy. And that ­decomposition is "a direct consequence of the mentalities, policies and actions of our ruling class": from tech moguls who market addictive video-games and social-media platforms to media and political elites who promote a moral agenda of "soft relativism." 
  From the right: Only China Is Losing in This Trade War 
  President Trump's "aggressive push on tariffs has thrown the country's expert class into a tizzy," notes Salvatore Babobes at The National Interest, even though "the economy is employing record numbers of people" and "inflation is running well below the Fed's target rate." China is the real loser, especially if it doesn't bend: "Its manufacturing base will continue moving to Vietnam and India. Less labor-intensive assembly work will move to Mexico, which has now displaced China as America's top trade partner. China will lose its unique position at the center of global production networks and, with it, much of its leverage over global politics." All good, because "when an expansionist totalitarian police state with no respect for the rule of law demands special concessions in the global trading system, then it's hard to have much sympathy." 
  Libertarian: Tulsi Gabbard Is Anti-War But Not Pro-Peace 
  "To be a force for peace in the world," America must "stop invading other countries for their benefit and . . . stop cultivating nasty regimes for its benefit," Shikha Dalmia argues at Reason. But "the very politicos who are ­anti-war often become pro-dictator," including Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The only 2020 Democrat to vow to "end wasteful regime-change wars" at the last debate, she "has no qualms about courting dictators if they advance her cause," embracing both Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. And she has reached out to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose "militant brand of Hindu nationalism is fundamentally transforming a liberal country into an illiberal one." 
  Urban wonk: The Regression of Progressive US Cities 
  "Policy agendas are turning many great cities into loony towns," ­laments Joel Kotkin in The Orange County Register. And the syndrome becomes a vicious circle. As the middle class and "political middle" flee, "city governments become more insulated from constituents who would be the most adamant about reforming school districts," fixing infrastructure and maintaining public order. In San Francisco, "decades of tolerance for . . . extreme deviant behavior has helped create a city with more drug addicts than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a 'poop map.' " Los Angeles, meanwhile, is "being overrun by rats," and its Skid Row neighborhood resembles "a Syrian refugee camp." Reversal of these declines will only come when those with a "strong stake in the local economy . . . decide to challenge . . . a virtue-signaling political class."

  Dayton, Ohio, mass murderer Connor Betts' online footprint provided a glimpse Tuesday into his dark thoughts and far-left political leanings even as investigators worked to pin down a concrete motive for the massacre. 
  "Millenials [sic] have a message for the Joe Biden generation: hurry up and die," read a message retweeted hours before the shooting by Twitter account ­@iamthespookster, which is believed to have belonged to Betts. 
  The account, yanked in the wake of the early-Sunday bloodbath, included multiple selfies that strongly resemble the 24-year-old, and a biography section that reflected what few details have emerged of his personal life, including "he / him / ­anime fan / metalhead / leftist." 
  It's capped with a dire declaration: "I'm going to hell and I'm not coming back." 
  The account fired off thousands of messages - including some supporting presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and the sometimes-violent antifa, or anti-fascist, movement - since it was created in 2013, according to The Washington Post, which captured more than 3,000 of the tweets before the page was pulled. 
  "I want socialism, and i'll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding," reads one tweet from the account, according to Newsweek.  
  The account retweeted posts blasting federal immigration agents as "monsters," and referring to migrant-detention centers along the southern border as "concentration camps" - echoing language used by New York Rep. Alexandria ­Ocasio-Cortez. 
  "Cut the fences down. Slice ICE tires. Throw bolt cutters over the fences," reads one message, encouraging people to actively resist the crackdown on illegal immigrants. 
  "Losing your personal information in a massive data breach is just a thing that happens now, like 110 degree days and regular mass shootings," reads another message. 
  Yet another posting, at odds with the Twitter account's stream of far-left talking points, encourages people to arm themselves. "Buy a gun and learn to use it responsibly," it reads. "you may need to protect yourself." 
  Betts' attack came only about 13 hours after Patrick Crusius, 21, allegedly slaughtered 22 people in El Paso, Texas, apparently motivated by far-right ideals, including a ­hatred of Hispanic immigrants. 
   Betts opened fire in a popular nightlife district using an AR-15-style rifle at about 1:05 a.m. Sunday. 
  He fatally shot nine fleeing innocents - including his 22-year-old sister, Megan - and wounded 14 more with gunfire before he was killed by police, just 30 seconds ­after his attack began. 
  Investigators said Tuesday that Betts embraced "very specific ideologies" ahead of his rampage, but refused to elaborate on the exact nature of those beliefs, stressing that the probe has a long way to go. Betts was an armed counterprotestor at Klu Klux Klan rally in May, a report said Tuesday. 
  His onslaught was the culmination of years of troubling red flags, according to two of Betts' former girlfriends. 
  "He would cry to me sometimes," high-school love interest Lyndsi Doll told The Washington Post. "How he's afraid of himself and afraid he was going to hurt someone one day. It's haunting now." 
  Caitlyn "Adelia" Johnson, who went out with Betts from March through May, said that on their first date, he showed off his seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of mass shootings from across the country. 
  "Do you know tragedies from every city?" Johnson recalled texting Betts after he showed her footage of the slaughter at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue. 
  Betts admitted he knew "a fair bit of them," Johnson told The Toledo Blade. 
  "That man who was so sweet to me and told me he loved me was a mass murderer," Johnson wrote in a post on Medium. "I kissed a mass murderer."

  Canada is taking steps to make it harder for asylum seekers to make refugee claims at the border if they've already been rejected by other countries, including the United States, according to a report.  
  Amendments were introduced in the government's budget bill after thousands of asylum-seekers crossed the Canadian border once the US rejected their claims, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday.  
  Border Security Minister Bill Blair said the legislation would put an end to "asylum shopping." 
  "There's a right way to come to the country to seek asylum and/or to seek to immigrate to this country, and we're trying to encourage people to use the appropriate channels and to disincentivize people from doing it improperly," Blair said. 
  Canada is processing more than 200,000 asylum claims.

The Issue: The shooting in El Paso, Texas that left 22 dead and the one in Dayton, Ohio, that claimed nine.  
  There can be no excuses for the violence perpetrated on the innocent people in an El Paso shopping mall ("Mall massacre," Aug. 4).  
  It was a venomous act, allegedly committed by a deranged and evil 21-year-old who was consumed with hate for immigrants. 
  Accused shooter Patrick Crusius is the textbook definition of a racist. Trump is not a racist. All the accounts Democrats cite relating to his racist remarks in Charlottesville have proven inaccurate. His rhetoric targeting illegal immigration is not racist.  
  Having said that, it is up to Trump to continue to embrace the American people, talk to us face-to-face, offer us words of consolation and state emphatically that he will not tolerate these horrific acts of terrorism on American soil. 
   Sharon Borenstein

  When will enough be enough? How many more shootings does it take before this president takes action to end senseless killings?  
  The president must take a stand to protect us from harm, end the violence and distance himself from the NRA.

  As someone who has taught and studied rhetoric for over 40 years, what we say or don't say matters. Enough with politicians calling for "thoughts and prayers." That only eases our minds, makes us feel better and normalizes violence. But it obscures the real problem.  
  Let's be candid about the contributory causes of this crisis - including easy access to high-capacity assault weapons, increasing mental illness and, yes, the incitement of hate and fear spurred by our president. Together, these constitute the perfect storm.  
  One thing is clear: As long as we have a president who incessantly spews racist and hateful words that are applauded by white nationalist and Republican leaders who are cowards and refuse to stop him, little progress will be made to fix this dangerous problem.

  The shooting at the mall that left at least 22 dead in El Paso raises pertinent issues.  
  Obviously, those who support strict gun control can cite the murders as an argument to limit the sale of such weapons.  
  Yet restricting the sale of guns is no answer when so many are already in the hands of citizens. In place of limiting gun sales, perhaps banning the sale and availability of ammunition should be considered.  
   Nelson Marans

  This administration has shown time and again it doesn't care. All those involved in this fiasco should be held accountable, and that includes members of Congress who, along with the president, are simply not taking action to stop the carnage.  
  Unfortunately, we have to wait until Election Day to oust this disgraceful bunch of know-nothings and do-nothings.  
  Anyone who thinks this president is doing a great job (with his foul-mouthed rhetoric, keeping the nation divided, praising dictators and demonizing the press and anyone who happens to disagree with him) is truly delusional. 
   He says he cares but only about himself, as he continues his daily barrage of lies and misinformation while supporting the NRA and stoking white nationalism.  
   Herb Stark 
   Mooresville 
  Another two shootings involving rapid-fire/large magazine military-type assault rifles (and a total of some 31 dead) within 24 hours, and Trump again cites "mental health" for these horrendous circumstances. 
  While not making light of those suffering mental-health problems, it is absolute lunacy to continue to allow the wrong set of guns to be sold in America to the wrong set of Americans. 
  Why give such people easy access to any type of gun in the first place - let alone to military-type assault weapons - to continue to slaughter American citizens in such great numbers?  
  Please do something. Trump. This could be your finest hour - or America's flags may well be perpetually flying at half-mast.

DOUBLE MASSACRE Trump raises the 'red flags' Calls for mental-health laws, not gun control

  President Trump condemned hate and "white supremacy" Monday as he called for bipartisan action to spur nationwide "red flag" laws in response to two weekend shootings that took the lives of 31 people in Texas and Ohio. 
  But he failed to mention new background-check measures or legislation to ban assault ­weapons. 
  "In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated," Trump said in his remarks, referring to the El Paso gunman's racist-filled manifesto, which targeted people of Mexican descent. 
   "Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul."  
  During the 10-minute speech from the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room, the president directed the Justice Department to work with local authorities on "red flag" laws that would identify people who might be likely to commit ­violence.  
  He noted how the Parkland, Fla., school shooter in February 2018 exhibited numerous signs that he would do something destructive but "nobody did anything." 
  The commander in chief called the back-to-back shootings in El Paso and Dayton, "domestic terrorism" and said he would ensure the FBI has whatever it needs to prevent further attacks. 
  "We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism," Trump said.  
  But he also cast blame on the Internet and video games, saying, "We must stop the glorification of violence in our society." 
  The president urged Congress to reform mental-health laws to ensure that psychologically disturbed individuals who may be prone to violence get treatment, and, if necessary, be ­involuntarily confined. He didn't offer any specifics on legislation. 
   "Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun," he said.  
  "First, we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs. I am directing the Department of Justice to work in . . . partnership with local, state and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike," Trump said. 
  And he directed the department to propose legislation that would make people who carry out hate crimes and mass shootings eligible for the death penalty.  
  Missing during his remarks was a recommendation that Congress take action on background checks or linking gun legislation to immigration reform, as he said in tweets earlier Monday morning.  
  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were quick to criticize.  
  "It took less than three hours for the president to back off his call for stronger background check legislation," the two Democratic leaders said in a joint statement. "When he can't mention guns while talking about gun violence, it shows the president remains prisoner to the gun lobby and the NRA." 
  Trump also failed to mention restricting access to assault rifles or an outright ban on the weapons, used in the two weekend attacks, with which a gunman can rattle off dozens of high-powered rounds per minute.  
  Instead he harked back to measures already taken. 
   "Last year, we enacted the STOP School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law . . . At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks," Trump said. 
  "If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain." 
  Striving for reform 
  Recent mass shootings have sparked a series of gun-control proposals in Congress: 
  * The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019: This legislation would close the "gun-show loophole" by prohibiting most private firearm sales unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer or importer first takes possession of the weapon to conduct a background check on the buyer. It passed the House in February by a vote of 240-190, with eight Republicans in favor and two Democrats opposed. 
  * The Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019: This bill would extend the time for a gun seller to obtain a federal background check on a buyer to 10 days, with the potential for another 10 if needed. Current law allows sales to go through if the check isn't finished within three days, which is how white nationalist Dylann Roof bought the .45-caliber Glock handgun he used to slaughter nine black worshippers at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC, in 2015. It passed the House in February, 
  on a largely party-line vote of 228-198. 
  * "Red flag" laws: These state laws, first endorsed by President Trump following last year's high-school massacre in Parkland, Fla., let authorities obtain "extreme-risk protection orders" to seize guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others, and prevent them from buying 
  any more until the orders are lifted. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have passed them, including New York, where a measure signed by Gov. Cuomo in February goes into effect on Aug. 24. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Monday announced plans for federal legislation encouraging the remaining states to pass similar laws. 
  NEW YORK POST EDITORIAL 
  "In the wake of two horrific mass shootings, President Trump on Monday offered welcome words and a few useful starting points to address the madness. But he - and all of Washington - have a long way to go."

  From the right: Beware the Shootings Blame Game 
  Democrats were quick to blame President Trump for the weekend's massacres in El Paso and Dayton, with Beto O'Rourke skewering "a president who's called Mexicans rapists and criminals." But, points out John Merline at Issues & Insights, the facts don't shake down so neatly. Yes, the El Paso shooter ranted about a "Hispanic invasion of Texas." But his manifesto also showed him to be an "anti-corporatist environmentalist and backer of universal health care." In other words, he "happens to share many policy positions with Democrats," yet mainstream reporters aren't seizing those similarities to blame leading liberals for his actions. And the Dayton shooter is even more problematic: He reportedly tweeted out his support for Sen. Liz Warren, writing, "I want socialism, and I'll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding." So, asks Merline: If Trump is to blame for El Paso, "is Warren to blame for [Dayton]?" 
  Culture critic: The Malaise Behind the Massacres 
  At The American Spectator, Melissa Mackenzie dreams of a "better world," where mass killers get no "notoriety" to inspire copycats and ­online chat rooms don't glorify "invective against women" or "a certain race." In reality, people, including politicians, use the "deaths of innocent people for political gain." Fact is, the "common thread" among the mass shooters isn't "politics," but that "we've brought up a generation of people who have everything and feel empty at the same time." Alas, solutions to such cultural crises don't come easy. "Maybe that's why people blame politics. It's easier." 
  From the left: Dems Are Pruning the Field Too Soon 
  The Democratic National Committee's rules for who will make it into the debates aren't serving the party well, argues Walter Shapiro at The New Republic. With a major culling to come this month, most candidates at last week's debate were "petrified" that the night "would be their swan song as legitimate candidates." That brought "a ferocity more common on the eve of the Iowa caucuses than during early encounters, when candidates normally would be introducing themselves and ballyhooing their accomplishments," and made the whole party seem "fractured by deep ideological fissures over health care, immigration and criminal justice." Worst, it appears DNC chief Tom Perez pushed the winnowing "to provide the TV networks with the dramatically smaller debate stages they crave for ratings." 
  Foreign desk: Putin's Home-Front Headache 
  Protesters poured into the streets of Moscow over the weekend to ­demand free and fair elections, and Vladimir Putin responded with brutality and mass arrests. Yet the Russian strongman "isn't flexing his strength so much as betraying weakness," argues The Wall Street Journal editorial board. Discontent is growing as the Kremlin squeezes the opposition, most notably the antigraft campaigner Alexei Navalny, and the economy deteriorates. "The risk now," says the Journal, "is that he picks a foreign fight - a new front in the Baltics or perhaps an escalation in the Sea of Azov - to distract from domestic troubles." That's all the more reason for the West to "make clear that any escalation abroad would be resisted and lead to more biting economic sanctions." 
  Free-speech watch: Don't Ban Killers' Manifestos 
  The Drudge Report and other outlets have come under fire for publishing the El Paso killer's 2,300-word manifesto. But John Fund in National Review warns that we shouldn't "make free speech another casualty of these murders." The document is full of paranoid talk of "race-mixing." Hideous stuff, yet there are important reasons not to suppress such material. For starters, it helps us learn about "the twisted motivations of mass killers." Plus, citizens should have ­access, since "the media can't always be counted on to provide a full interpretation or context of their motivations." Indeed, "even German authorities recently legalized the publication of 'Mein Kampf,' saying that people needed to understand the nature of evil and how it expressed itself."

DOUBLE MASSACRE Buttigieg rips NRA's 'false God' Dems, Trump react

  Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg compared guns to a "false God" on Sunday as he and a slew of officials responded to the deadly back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.  
  "Here's something to think about this Sunday morning: Is a gun a tool or is it an idol?" the South Bend, Ind., mayor, who served in Afghanistan as a Navy reservist, said on CNN's "State of the Union."  
  "Any time I've carried or handled a weapon . . . I've viewed it as a tool, but if the gun corporation lobby, which is what the NRA is, now has people viewing guns as a thing to be loved, a thing to be protected, a thing that is the source of our freedom and power and a thing to which we are willing to sacrifice human life, isn't that the definition of a false god?"  
  President Trump, meanwhile, said he discussed the attacks with Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray and would make a statement at 10 a.m. Monday. 
  "Hate has no place in our country, and we're going to take care of it," he said before returning to the White House from a weekend at his Bedminster, NJ, golf resort.  
  He earlier issued a tweet on the law-enforcement response and another saying "God bless" the people of El Paso and Dayton. 
  His daughter and adviser, Ivanka, condemned the El Paso shooter's hateful ideology, tweeting that "white supremacy, like all other forms of terrorism, is an evil that must be eradicated" and urging people to "raise our voices in rejection of these heinous and cowardly acts of hate, terror and violence." 
  Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native, responded, "Yes, I do," when asked on CNN's "State of the Union" if he thought Trump was a white nationalist. 
  "We have a problem with white nationalist terrorism in the United States of America today," the former congressman said. 
   "These are white men motivated by the kind of fear that this president traffics in," he added.  
  Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney hit back on ABC's "This Week," accusing the 2020 candidate of playing politics. Mulvaney cited the 2017 attack in which a Bernie Sanders supporter opened fire on a congressional baseball-game practice, killing a cop and wounding Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and two others, and a rifle-toting man's attack last month on an immigration detention facility in Tacoma, Wash. 
  "Here's the question you could ask Beto . . . 'Look, did anyone blame Bernie Sanders for the congressional baseball game shooting?' No, I don't think so," he said. 
  "Did anyone blame Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for the . . . crazy guy who tried to blow up the DHS office in Washington state, taking, I think, a homemade bomb and an AR-15 to shoot up what he called a concentration camp, the exact same rhetoric that AOC was using?"

THE DEM DEBATES Slip-slidin' Biden trips Stumbles through onslaught by Booker, Harris and Blasio

  Front-running Joe Biden stumbled through his second Democratic-primary debate Wednesday night in the face of a withering assault by Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Kamala Harris and even Mayor de Blasio. 
  The former vice president was repeatedly caught flat-footed as the trio smelled blood in the ­water and fought to close the polling gap, hammering Biden in a debate that delivered the fire absent in Tuesday's installment. 
  That fire was most often focused on Biden, who was grilled on his Obama-era positions on immigration and health care, as well as his early-career stances on criminal justice and the Iraq War - forcing him into a staggering verbal retreat dotted with aborted trains of thought. 
  "Anyway . . . ." Biden trailed off multiple times as he struggled to answer attacks and pivot from the defensive. 
  Even a full-throated Detroit audience vaulted onto the dog-pile, with a handful of protesters chanting, "Three million deportations!" as Biden fielded a question on the mass Obama-era ouster of illegal immigrants from the United States. 
  "If you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back," said Biden. "It's a crime." 
  The response invited a cross-Hudson tag team of de Blasio and New Jersey's Booker. 
  "No, Mr. Vice President, we're not going to just let people cross the border," said Booker, who favors civil penalties, not criminal charges, for illegal immigrants. 
  Added de Blasio, "Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations . . . I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power, your influence in the White House." 
  Biden sidestepped, floundering to defend President Barack Obama's record - and his own - by incorrectly stating that Obama signed into law the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which was established by executive order. 
  But de Blasio refused to let the issue go, pressing, "You want to be president of the United States. You need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you, if you're debating Donald Trump, he's not going to let you off the hook." 
  To that, Biden pleaded Oval Office confidentiality: "I keep my relationship private . . . I expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately." 
  But Booker pounced and delivered one of the night's most stinging rebukes. "You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign," lashed Booker. "You can't do it when it's convenient and dodge it when it's not." 
  De Blasio hardly escaped the debate unscathed, getting targeted for his handling of the lead-contamination crisis in New York's public-housing system, as well as his refusal to ax the NYPD officer involved in the death of Eric Garner - a point that saw Hizzoner receive his own dose of audience heckling. 
  But it was the two-term vice president who wore the biggest bull's-eye throughout the night. 
  Booker hit home again as ­Biden frailly tried to insist that there was little difference between their criminal-justice platforms, an issue over which the two sparred in the media in the days before the debate. 
  "If you want to compare rec­ords - and frankly I'm shocked that you do," offered Booker. 
  Biden then pivoted 180 degrees, trying to attack Booker's criminal-justice record, including the use of stop-and-frisk while he was mayor of Newark. 
  "There's a saying in my community: You're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor," came the crowd-pleasing Booker retort. 
  A frazzled Biden couldn't even stick the landing in his closing statement, flubbing his call for donations by saying, "Go to Joe 30330 and help me in this fight." 
  He presumably meant to say, "Text JOIN to 30330," displayed correctly on his campaign's Twitter account. 
  Harris, who shot up the polls after June's first round of debates in Miami by hammering Biden, tried to double down on the strategy. 
  But she was forced to fend off blows, particularly on her have-it-all-ways health-care plan and her record as a ­prosecutor in California. 
  New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro got in some licks of their own on women's issues and immigration, respectively. 
  The remainder of the 10 White House hopefuls - Washington Gov. Jay Inslee; Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet; Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Andrew Yang - generally took a less aggressive approach, and consequently found themselves buried amid the fireworks that resulted from a seemingly looser CNN production than the one that dammed the flow on Tuesday night. 
  'Zzzzz zzzzzzz zzzzzz zzzzzzz zzzzzz.' 
  - Colo. Sen. Michael Bennet  
  'I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege is.' 
  - NY Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand 
  'It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't.' 
  - Former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, blasting Joe Biden over immigration prosecutions 
  'There's a saying in my community that 'you're dipping into the Kool- Aid and you don't even know the flavor.' 
  - NJ Sen. Cory Booker, shooting back at Biden 
  'Go easy on me, kid.' 
  - Former Vice President Joe Biden, to Kamala Harris as they took the stage. 
  'There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable. I've seen people go to prison for far less.' 
  - Calif. Sen. Kamala Harris, on the Mueller report 
  'The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.' 
  - Former tech executive Andrew Yang  
  'The people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor, you owe them an apology.' 
  - Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, blasting Harris  
  'We can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House.' 
  - Wash. Gov. Jay Inslee  
  'When I am president, we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy.' 
  - NY Mayor Bill de Blasio

  The Pentagon said Tuesday it has awarded nearly $1 billion in contracts to two companies for President Trump's border wall - the first funds granted to build the barrier since Trump declared a national emergency in February.  
  SLSCO Ltd. was awarded a $789 million contract for "border-replacement wall construction," which will be done in Santa Teresa, NM. 
   The work is expected to be completed in October 2020, according to a list of contracts published by the US Department of Defense.  
  In addition, Barnard Construction Co. Inc., a Montana-based company, was awarded an $187 million contract for a wall-replacement project in Yuma, Ariz. That work is expected to be finished in September 2020, according to records.  
  The barriers will be constructed as "30-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate," a DOD spokesman told The Hill.

  Democrats in the Legislature set aside $27 million in tuition assistance for the children of illegal immigrants in the new state budget - but wouldn't add hundreds of thousands of dollars to expand a similar program for kids of deceased and disabled veterans. 
  A bill that has twice passed the state Senate - but never made it through the Assembly - would have added funding to a program that provides free tuition, room and board at any SUNY or CUNY college to children, spouses and dependents of "fallen soldiers" who died, became severely disabled or were classified as missing in action while serving in the military after 1990. 
  Such a program already exists and serves 145 students at a cost of $2.7 million - but only for relatives and dependents of vets who served in combat zones.  
  The Assembly Higher Education Committee voted 15-11 against allocating more funds to broaden the existing program as part of the state budget. 
  Assemblywoman Deborah Glick (D-Manhattan), who chairs the committee, said budget constraints weighed against the expansion for now. 
  "We will make every effort to ensure going forward, we have some additional resources allocated to the program so that as an entitlement, it is not falling short of the needs of our military families," she said. 
  But State Sen. Robert Ortt (R-Niagara), a sponsor of the bill, said the Assembly's failure to act sends a distressing message to military families.  
  "Assemblywoman Glick should be ashamed of herself," said Ortt. "We set aside $27 million for college for people that are here illegally. . . Apparently $2.7 million is all that the families of soldiers who are killed, get. If you're a child of a fallen solider, you do not rank as high and you know that by the money."  
  Glick called the criticism a "cheap shot" on Twitter. 
  "The bill - though laudable - had a budgetary impact which the committee routinely doesn't consider post-budget. We did promise to see funding in the future [that] considers potential additional eligible individuals. Cheap shot," she wrote. 
  Assemblywoman Judy Griffin (D-L.I), one of four Assembly Democrats who voted in favor of the bill, said it should be a priority next year.  
  Griffin said she "voted yes knowing the bill would be held because it was a tough budget year" and "there just wasn't the funding. But now we know for next year, [so] we will make it a priority and hopefully pass it."

  Illegal immigrants from 50 different countries - including China, Bangladesh, Turkey, Egypt and Romania - have been caught crossing into the US from Mexico, a top Border Patrol official ­testified Tuesday. 
  "People are traveling across hemispheres to attempt to illegally enter the US, using the same pathways as the Central Americans," Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing.  
  The revelation came as President Trump said he would not relaunch his administration's policy of separating children from their families at the southern border - but continued railing against the surge of Central American asylum seekers seeking entry to the US. 
  Karisch said a caravan-sized group of migrants flooded across the border each week in just a single sector, which he called the latest indicator of the growing migration crisis on the ­Mexico-US border. 
  "Much media attention has focused on caravans coming across from Central America," said Karisch, who has been assigned to the sector since January after serving in Arizona.  
  "But the fact is that RGV [Rio Grande Valley] is receiving caravan-equivalent numbers every seven days." 
  Karisch said Border Patrol has apprehended more asylum-seeking families crossing the border in the first five months of fiscal 2019 than during all of fiscal 2012. 
   Trump, meanwhile, refuted multiple reports said that he wanted the family separation policy not only revived but strengthened.  
  "We're not looking to do that now," he said during an Oval Office sit-down with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, his second White House visit since Trump took office. 
  But even as he disavowed it, Trump argued the policy was an effective deterrent to asylum-seeking migrants. 
  "When you don't do it, it brings a lot more people to the border. I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'Let's go to Disneyland,' " Trump said. 
  His comments also came as Customs and Border Protection officials revealed that 103,492 asylum seekers and other undocumented immigrants were apprehended at the southern border in March - more than double the number last March and an increase of more than 26,000 from February. 
  Trump has railed against the rising numbers and is searching for ways to staunch the flow. 
  The president also angrily blamed his predecessor for instituting the separations in the first place. 
  "Just so you understand, President Obama separated the children. Those cages that were shown - I think they were very inappropriate - were by President Obama's administration not by Trump. President Obama had child separation," he said, referring to steel cages at a border detention facility where children were kept. 
  Jeh Johnson, chief of the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration's second term, has said children were only separated in rare circumstances, like when authorities suspected human trafficking or people falsely claimed to be parents of unrelated children. 
  Trump charged the border has become a gateway for criminals.  
   "We have murderers coming in. We have drug lords coming in. We have gangs coming in. We are stopping them, and if we don't stop them, ICE is throwing them the hell out. We want homeland security and that's what we're gonna get!"

ANTI-IMMIGRANT TERRORIST AN ONLINE MANIACAL MANIFESTO

   A half hour before the Saturday-morning massacre at a Walmart in the Texas border city of El Paso, a seething, anti-immigrant manifesto appeared on the Web site 4chan and 8chan, and, by evening, investigators were probing if it was posted by shooting suspect Patrick Crucius. 
  Authorities had yet to confirm if it had been written by Crucius, El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen told reporters during an evening press conference.  
  "Right now we have a manifesto from this individual, that indicates to some degree, it has a nexus to potential hate crime," Allen said - sounding uncomfortable even speaking about the disturbing document. 
  The manifesto, titled "The Inconvenient Truth," starts out proclaiming the author's support for the March shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. 
  "This attack," the author then says, in an apparent reference to his own sick handiwork, "is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas." 
  "They are the instigators, not me," he rails.  
  "I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion," the author wrote. 
  Three citizens of Mexico were among the dead, and six were among the injured, Mexican officials said Saturday night. 
  The Walmart is adjacent to the sprawling Cielo Vista Mall, a popular shopping destination among Mexican tourists. 
  The manifesto bemoans that "America is rotting from the inside out," and predicts that "the heavy Hispanic population in Texas will make us a Democrat stronghold."  
  It goes on to blame immigration for everything from to the loss of jobs to runaway pollution. 
  Then the author writes about his weaponry, griping that he'd rather have used something far more powerful.  
  "Main gun: AK47," the author states under the heading, "Gear." 
  "I realized pretty quickly that this isn't a great choice since it's the civilian version of the ak47," he complains. 
  "It's not designed to shoot rounds quickly," he laments. 
  "So it overheats massively after about 100 shots fired in quick succession." 
  The author goes on to humble-brag about having spent less than a month, not much time at all, preparing for the attack. 
  "I have do this before I lose my nerve," he wrote. 
  "I figured that an under-prepared attack and a meh manifesto is better than attack and no manifesto." 
  He sees his actions as "faultless," he adds. 
  And he's not a racist, he claims. "This isn't an act of imperialism but an act of preservation," he writes of the ­attack. 
  "America is full of hypocrites who will blast my actions as the sole result of racism and hatred of other countries, despite the extensive evidence of all the problems these invaders cause and will cause. 
  Governments kill millions through "imperialistic wars," he "reasons" - so why shouldn't he?  litaliano@nypost.com

POSTSCRIPT Dems' Race To Extremes

  Last week's debates removed any remaining doubt: The crazies rule the roost, with even the "moderate" Democrats pushing policies far to the left of President Barack Obama's.  
  Some wailed about their competitors' "unrealistic" visions and "fairy-tale economics" - even as their own ideas were straight out of the Brothers Grimm classics. 
  On health care, ex-Veep Joe Biden, supposedly one of the least extreme of the lot, says he wants to "build" on ObamaCare by adding a "public option" that (though Biden doesn't say so) would inevitably replace ObamaCare.  
  The price tag: $750 billion - nearly the original estimated cost of ObamaCare itself. And Biden's the moderate? 
  Sen. Kamala Harris complains that Biden's plan wouldn't cover all Americans. Hers would - by putting every American into government-paid health care within a fixed 10 years. 
  Sens. Bernie Sanders and Liz Warren, meanwhile, want to put the government in charge and end all private insurance - yesterday. Who cares if it costs $30 trillion-with-a-T over 10 years? 
  Rep. John Delaney pointed out one deadly flaw in all these plans, which would pay bills at Medicare's rates, which don't cover providers' costs: "I've been going around rural America, and I ask rural hospital administrators one question: 'If all your bills were paid at the Medicare rate last year, what would happen?' And they all look at me and say, 'We would close.' "  
  Delaney is one of the also-rans, with no chance of making the next debate. The same is true of Rep. Tim Ryan, who also offered occasional sanity.  
  They also fought over who'll open the nation's borders widest. Several, like Sen. Cory Booker and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, promise to decriminalize illegal border crossings, making them merely civil violations - de facto open borders. 
  Warren backs that, too. But she also wants probes of how Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have treated migrants. Show trials! 
  On climate change, Delaney slammed the Green New Deal - yet vowed to get to "net zero [carbon emissions] by 2050," which is just impossible. Gov. Jay Inslee says, "We have to get off of fossil fuels in our electrical grid" in 15 years.  
  Andrew Yang almost comes off as the realist: We're 10 years too late, he sighs. It's time to "start moving our people to higher ground." 
  On race, the extremism was less obvious, aside from the candidates pushing the fringe idea of taxpayer "reparations" to the descendants of slaves. When host Don Lemon basically asked the candidates to call President Trump a racist, they all jumped in - with Inslee even offering "white nationalist." 
  Warren's big applause line: "The president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal-justice racism, health-care racism," leaving no slur behind. Thing is, Trump's policies on all those fronts are utterly race-blind - Warren was simply forwarding the pernicious idea that any policy the left doesn't like is racist. 
  Yet Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand likely won the "woke" sweepstakes with her offer to lecture white suburban women on "white privilege." Never mind that the implication is that the vast majority of white Americans are racists, they just don't know it.  
  Some of the hardest lefties, like Mayor de Blasio, will soon wash out along with the less-impractical candidates. But it seems certain that the survivors will all embrace what Delaney calls the "free everything and impossible promises" approach that will "get Trump re-elected." Sad.

US won't let hulk muscle in Iranian a Vegas no-go

  One of the strongest men alive may prove no match for US Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
  Hadi Choopan, a 31-year-old bodybuilder from Iran, has been blowing away competitors across the world but will be unable to participate in the Mr. Olympia contest in Las Vegas next month because he hasn't been able to get a visa approval from the agency. 
  Choopan, known to fans as the "Persian wolf," has qualified for the September 12-15 event and his name is prominently featured on the Mr. Olympia Web site. The competition is considered the Super Bowl of professional body building and helped launch the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who won it seven times. 
  "What he's really known for is the legs and his dry, ripped crazy conditioning. He is just out-of-his-mind shredded," said Steve Ioannou, a New York-based bodybuilder and coach. "He's like 5'5, 220 and has like no body fat." 
  Bob Cicherillo, a former bodybuilder and emcee for Mr. Olympia since 2005, said, "I would like to see him, the pro league would like to see him, and the fans would like to see him competing. The guy is a talent. He's one of the best in the world." 
  Choopan won the International Federation of BodyBuilding event last month in Vancouver - with no visa difficulties from Canadian authorities. 
  "This is a governmental thing between the US and Iran," Cicherillo said.  
  "We support Hadi Choopan as an IFBB pro athlete. He is a member in good standing," Cicherillo added. "I've never heard a bad word about him personally." 
  "He's Iranian," Dave Palumbo, who owns the bodybuilding fan Web site RXmuscle, told The Post. "That's the problem. 
  "I've called for the government to grant Hadi a visa based on the fact that he's an elite-level athlete who should be immune from the politics and sanctions against his government," Palumbo said.  
  Iran was one of the terror-prone nations listed on a travel ban instituted by President Trump in 2017.

  From the left: Pelosi & Co. Yearn for Obama 
  "Moderate progressive Democrats" now "mounting a sustained counter to the party's lurch to the left" privately "would like an assist from the only Democrat who might make a difference: former President Barack Obama," reports Al Hunt at The Hill. Though he has warned against ideological "purity" in the party, Obama "has kept a very low profile," even as 2020 candidates and The Squad "are forcefully pushing extremely liberal positions on issues like immigration, free college tuition and slavery reparations." At the least, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other mainstream and moderate party figures wish he would "directly call on Democrats" to save the Affordable Care Act from the threat of single-payer - which polls "and most Democratic House members from swing districts" see "as a general election disaster." 
  Iconoclast: Blame US Hawks for Global Migration Crisis 
  The recent drowning of some 150 Italian-bound African migrants in the Mediterranean "is a tragedy for which the United States is ultimately to blame," fumes The Week's Matthew Walther. "Our disastrous interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and Yemen have turned North Africa and the Middle East into a hellscape." The sheer number of migrants fleeing from these regions has forced immigration to the center of European politics: "Parties that promised to restrict it have won elections and referendums throughout the continent, from Britain to Switzerland to Hungary." Too bad "none of our own leaders have accepted responsibility. The idea that the American foreign policy consensus is largely responsible for the rise of xenophobic nationalist parties throughout Europe seems never to have occurred to the luminaries at the Council on Foreign Relations who wag their fingers at the European far right." 
  From the right: 'Woke' Racism 
  At American Greatness, Victor Davis Hanson takes aim at "the woke identity politics movement" where "obsessions with racial privilege and tribal exceptionalism are justified by accusing others of just such bias." Thus the "hip new racists" cheer Rep. Ayanna Pressley's claim that "We don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice" - which, Hanson notes, is "the classic anti-Enlightenment mindset: we are all permanent captives of our superficial race, religion, and sexual orientation." As a result, "intersectionality becomes a logical contest among professed victims to acquire preeminent tribal victimhood" - which "leads to sectarian warfare, not harmony." The madness won't end until "the majority of Americans of all racial heritages are brave enough to call out" these radicals as "the purveyors of hate themselves."  
  Subway beat: Will Cuomo Show His Hand on Homeless? 
  The new Metropolitan Transportation Authority task force to address the problems homeless people cause in the subways "provides an opportunity for Governor Andrew Cuomo to show his hand as to what he thinks should be done," notes Stephen Eide at City Journal. Though Cuomo's work on homelessness goes back to the '80s, he "has rarely intervened" in recent years "as New York City's crisis drags on." One big thing "Cuomo could clear up is what role nonvoluntary approaches should play." And the biggest key to success is for the task force "to consult less with experts in poverty services and more with those who work closely with the seriously mentally ill." 
  Media watch: CNN's Biased Chyrons 
  At The Washington Examiner, Quin Hillyer wants to know if CNN has "lost all standards" for "distinguishing news from opinion." He cites screen-bottom chyrons the network recently displayed reading "Politics of Hate" with the subhead, "Trump using racism as a political strategy in new rhetoric." Those are not "incontrovertible facts," Hillyer argues, but "assertions" quite "unmoored" from "dispassionate reporting," and so they amount to "bias, pure and simple." The network shouldn't call what it does "news." Rather, CNN should rename itself the "Cable Opinion-Spewers Network." Until then, "get some professionalism. Let viewers think for ourselves. Get a grip."

Immigration is key to saving Social Security

  Today's column is about Social Security and immigration - two topics that don't seem to have much in common - but in my opinion they do.  
  And if I'm right, you might decide to reconsider your position on immigration.  
  First, I believe people should be stopped from illegally entering the US. Period. Exclamation point!  
  We have to fix lax controls at our borders. And foreigners who overstay temporary visas have to be rounded up and unceremoniously sent back to where they came from.  
  We have the obligation to protect ourselves from physical attacks and from people who merely want to take advantage of our country's kindness.  
  Border wall? I don't think it will keep out the determined illegal immigrants who are likely to make the most trouble. We need something - but something better. Something high-techy. A great big wall was state of the art in 220 BC. 
  And we should give visas and green cards only to people who we'd want as neighbors, who are likely to contribute to our society and America's well-being no matter what country they are from. And if these legal immigrants want to stay and become citizens, that's even better. 
  And those already here illegally who haven't behaved should get kicked out.  
  Now the biggest and most contentious issue: What about illegal immigrants who have behaved? Let's say someone who is here illegally has worked regularly, paid taxes, hasn't gotten arrested, raised a family and contributed to their community. 
  They are the folks who just got off work and are standing next to you watching the kids play baseball and soccer. 
  These people are still here illegally. And because of that we can't, and shouldn't, completely ignore the fact that they entered this country without permission. 
   They broke the law - and a country can't selectively enforce laws. 
  In this case, I propose that these illegal immigrants be allowed to stay in the US - but only if they obtain a sponsor who will not only vouch for their character but also come to their assistance if they get into trouble financially. If they lose a job, for instance, this sponsor will help pay their bills so the illegal immigrant won't have to receive assistance from the state or federal government.  
  And this sponsor doesn't have to be a neighbor. It can also be an organization or someone who has immigration close to their heart.  
  So if the Catholic Church or George Soros or the Clinton Foundation feels so strongly about allowing illegals to stay here then these people or organizations can take on the financial responsibility for a period of time and relieve taxpayers of the obligation. 
  I think special treatment needs to be given to the Dreamers, the approximately 1.8 million kids who were brought into the US illegally by their parents. Even President Trump looks like he is working on a path to citizenship for the Dreamers, but his idea comes with a catch - funding part of his beautiful Mexico wall.  
  The family sponsorship program I envision above would already cover a lot of the Dreamers. So there will probably be far fewer than 1.8 million who'd have to be taken care of separately. 
  OK, let's say you are one of those people who doesn't give a damn about immigration despite America's long and cherished history of accepting people from other countries. Let's say you are one of those get-them-all-the-hell-out-of-here types. 
  Well, Social Security is going to have a tough time making payments to workers who retire years from now unless the working population in America grows dramatically.  
  One thing you already know about Social Security: It is not a gift from the government. I've paid hundreds of thousands of dollars into Social Security. And you probably have also. 
  But the government controls this money like it was an entitlement. Washington can, and probably will, change when you can start collecting, the rules under which you can retire and the amounts you get when you do.  
  It's your money but Washington rules over it.  
  Social Security is also a pyramid scheme - a Ponzi scheme is a less polite term. The system only works when there is more money coming in than is being paid out. 
  So far this pyramid has worked because Americans were producing a lot of babies - or, to put it another way, a lot of future workers.  
  Americans might suddenly go crazy and again start having lots of kids. But that's not likely given the cost of raising children nowadays. And even if there was another baby boom, that wouldn't help for another 18 years or so when those newborns start entering the workforce. 
  So the only answer to keep the Social Security pyramid functioning is to allow people from other countries to come here to work, pay taxes and contribute to Social Security. 
  I find this distasteful to say but it has always been true: Immigrants also tend to fill jobs that Americans don't want. True, many immigrants have also gone on to great things - founding some phenomenal tech giants that employ thousands. 
  Part of America's current dislike for immigration has to do with the fact that this country has been producing too few jobs over the past 10 years. Hopefully we'll fix that problem some day.  
  Once there are too many jobs in America a lot of people will probably change their attitude toward people from other countries. You should start thinking about changing now.

'Our hearts are broken' Slain Mollie's kin grieve amid immigration furor

  A judge on Wednesday ordered the accused murderer of 20-year-old Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts held in lieu of $5 million bail - as his lawyer claimed, without evidence, that his client is not an illegal immigrant. 
  It was the first public appearance for Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, a Mexican who appears to have used a stolen ID to pose as a legal immigrant and work for the past four years on the cattle farm of a prominent Iowa Republican. 
  Investigators say Rivera has confessed to kidnapping Tibbetts as she jogged past farmland a month ago, leaving her body to rot in a field in Poweshiek County, hidden under cornstalks. 
  The crime devastated the young woman's family - "Our hearts are broken," members said in a statement Wednesday - and inspired President Trump to reiterate his tough-on-immigration stance. 
  "Mollie Tibbetts an incredible young woman, is now permanently separated from her family," Trump said in a video statement tweeted Wednesday night. 
  "A person came in from Mexico, illegally, and killed her," he went on. 
  "We need the wall. We need our immigration laws changed, we need our border laws changed. We need Republicans to do it because Democrats aren't going to do it."  
  Trump's s statement prompted Rivera's defense lawyer to seemingly mock the president in a court filing seeking a media gag. 
   "Sad and sorry Trump has weighed in on this matter in national media which will poison the entire possible pool of jury members," the lawyer, Allan Richards, wrote. 
  Richards is also claiming that Rivera is a legal immigrant who came to the United States as a minor and who has only a seventh- or eighth-grade education. 
  Rivera had been in good standing as an employee, Yarrabee Farms President Eric Lang told The Associated Press - adding that the suspect even passed an extra layer of vetting, through the Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify system, which cross-referenced his ID with DHS and Social Security records. 
  Lang is the brother of Craig Lang, a farmer who recently lost the 2018 Republican primary for state agriculture secretary. 
  A law-enforcement source countered in The Washington Post that Rivera used a stolen ID. 
  Rivera, meanwhile, sat through a bail hearing wearing handcuffs and earphones for a Spanish interpreter's translation.  
  "Please remember, Evil comes in EVERY color," Tibbitts' aunt, Billie Jo Calderwood, said on Facebook Wednesday in an apparent counterpoint to hard-line tough-on-immigration rhetoric.

Biden 'surprised' by rivals' O-utrage

  Former Vice President Joe Biden said he "expected" to be challenged by his rivals at the Democratic presidential debate but was "surprised" by the level of attacks against former President Barack Obama. 
  "I expected it," Biden told reporters Thursday. "I was a little surprised at how much incoming was about Barack, about the president." 
  Obama's record on immigration was widely criticized by the candidates, and his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, became a casualty of the discussion around "Medicare for All."  
  Eric Holder, Obama's attorney general, warned Democrats to tread lightly.  
  "To my fellow Democrats. Be wary of attacking the Obama record. Build on it. Expand it. But there is little to be gained - for you or the party - by attacking a very successful and still popular Democratic President," he posted on Twitter.  
   But while the cannibalistic blitz gave Democrats pause, it gave Republicans reason to cheer. 
  "It was nice to see Democrats finally go after Obama's failed policies very aggressively. Wish they would have done that years ago," Donald Trump Jr. tweeted. 
  GOP strategist Rick Wilson chalked up the Democrats' performance to their being inept at politics.  
  "I will always point to the fact that many of their leading candidates for 2020 spent last night taking a giant dump on Barack Obama," Wilson tweeted. "It's almost as if you're trying to re-elect Trump, so go you." 
  Sen. Kamala Harris, who sparred with Biden during the debate about their competing health care proposals, softened her stance Thursday.  
  "Many presidents before him tried to reform the American health-care system. He actually got it done," the California Democrat said.

The Issue: Thousands of Central American migrants who are traveling to the US border to request asylum. 
  While some people are busy vilifying and chastising President Trump over his outspoken immigration policy, all seem to be overlooking comments by former Sen. Harry Reid, Sen. Chuck Schumer and the liberal standard-bearer himself, President Barack Obama, who all made speeches advocating similar policies ("Trump a road warrior," Nov. 6).  
  They called for protecting our borders, limiting the entry of illegal aliens, etc., yet there were few who came out in opposition to such policies at that time.  
  The bleeding-heart liberals and Trump-haters have selective memories. All they have is their hatred for Trump and anything that he is trying to accomplish. Alan Brooks 
   Brooklyn 
  The hundreds of millions in US aid sent to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala is clearly not having its desired effect as thousands of migrants flee.  
  US taxpayers should stop being forced to subsidize these failed countries, whose citizens will soon crash our southern border.  
  If allowed in, the cost could be untold billions in social services, health-care, education, et al.  
   Michael Maurer  
   Long Branch, NJ 
  How can the Pentagon be resisting the president's request to send troops to our southern border to help the Department of Homeland Security stop the caravan? 
  This caravan is a grave threat to our sovereignty and security.  
   A ndrew Delaney 
   Manhattan 
  If the Democrats were truly interested in the health of the American people, shouldn't they be opposing the caravans and open borders? 
   How many new diseases have already been introduced into the US by illegal immigrants? How many diseases that were eradicated in the US could the illegal immigrants bring back?  
   Glee Stocker 
   Cape Coral, Fla. 
  Although I am concerned about illegal immigrants with criminal records entering the United States, I'm more apprehensive about the RFK foundation bailing out violent criminals from Rikers, and Gov. Cuomo's liberal parole board releasing cop-killers. Tom Stagg

THE DEM DEBATES 'MOD' SQUAD VS. LIB SQUAD Centrists challenge lefties in CNN's debateus interruptus

  The second round of the Democratic primary debates saw far-left candidates fending off barbs from their centrist opponents - at least when any of them could get a word in edgewise over the moderators. 
  Ten White House hopefuls - just half of an overstuffed field - spent as much time discussing health care, immigration and gun violence as they did tripping over each other and three CNN moderators with pleas for more time. 
  "Please respect the rules," was a frequent admonishment delivered throughout the night by CNN's Jake Tapper, Dana Bash and Don Lemon, with most candidates on the receiving end at some point. 
  "No!" a fed-up Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren finally pushed back at one point in the debate's third act, shaking her head as she persisted to rebut an attack. 
  The tightly enforced rules, intended to keep a leash on the crowded field onstage at Detroit's Fox Theatre, allotted 60 seconds to answer a direct question, and a scant 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals to direct call-outs. 
  What filtered through to millions of viewers at home through the disruptive format was the ideological and generational gulf separating Warren and fellow uber-liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, from their eight moderate - but lower-polling - opponents. 
  "I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not fairy-tale promises," said former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, in a not-so-veiled broadside at Warren and Sanders' ambitious platforms, which include universal health care and forgiveness of student debt. 
  "I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for," parried Warren, showing her fire wasn't reserved for the moderators with a response that drew raucous applause. 
  Sanders offered a similar dream-big sentiment, saying, "I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas." 
  South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg - who, at just 37, repeatedly positioned himself as the party's youthful face of the future - urged the field to focus on sharpening the best policy, not a policy that can be sold to Republicans. 
  "It's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda, they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists," said Buttigieg. "If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they're going to do? Say we're a bunch of crazy socialists." 
  That call for a unified vision came in response to a question about universal Medicare, the first of the big ideas on which the candidates sparred. 
  Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan tried to undercut Sanders' insistence that his "Medicare for All" proposal will guarantee dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses for seniors, interrupting, "You don't know that, Bernie." 
  "I do know!" snapped the famously irascible Vermont democratic socialist. "I wrote the damn bill!" 
  The pair clashed again when Sanders pointed out that polls have him topping President Trump in the 2020 race. 
  "Hillary Clinton was winning in the polls, too," chided Ryan. 
  Despite the fleeting flashes of fireworks, it was the restrictive format that ruled at the expense of back-of-the-pack candidates, who included former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and self-help author Marianne Williamson. 
  Many of the millions of viewers watching at home skewered the format on social media. 
  "The time limit is horrible," tweeted @SandraCoppola7. "I stopped watching when I realized no one could finish an answer to a question." 
  Joked another viewer, "Jake Tapper is going to TURN THIS DEBATE RIGHT AROUND AND GO HOME if the candidates don't adhere to the time limits." 
  A third watcher wrote, "This format is a disaster." 
  One viewer who resisted the urge to chime in was President Trump. The president - who tweeted during last month's first debates in Miami that the proceeding was "BORING!" - told reporters that he would be watching the followup matches, but sat on his fingers throughout Tuesday's meandering event, which ran past 2¹/  hours. 
  Ten more candidates will take the stage Wednesday night. 
  They include front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and three metropolitan-area leaders - Mayor de Blasio, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.

Calling Out Cummings: Trump's Jabs at Baltimore

The Issue: President Trump's tweets attacking Rep. Elijah Cummings and the conditions in his district.  
  President Trump is 100 percent correct to call out Rep. Elijah Cummings for the suffering city of Baltimore ("And the hits keep Cummings," July 29).  
  Any way you look at it, similar cities under Democratic control, such as Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Los Angeles (where residents may soon be facing the Bubonic Plague) often have the most violent crime, poverty and unemployment. 
  The cries of "racism" are ludicrous. It's the best the Democrats can do to defend the indefensible.  
  If Rep. Cummings can't clean up his district's mess in nearly four decades on the job, he is in the wrong business.  
   Trump is right to speak the truth, and I applaud him for speaking out against politics as usual. 
   Dori Harasek,  Staten Island 
  As someone who voted for Trump and will more than likely vote for him again in 2020, I was disgusted to see his comments about Baltimore and Rep. Cummings. 
  Although probably true about the condition of Baltimore, why does he have to be so obnoxious? I am embarrassed by his comments. 
  He has produced a lot of good things, such as a stronger economy, good growth, fewer rules and regulations, a stronger military and so on.  
  When I get letters from the Trump 2020 campaign asking for money, I send it back with a comment: "When you learn to shut your mouth, I will send money."  
   Francis Quinn,  Lavallette, NJ 
  I took my grandkids to Baltimore's Camden Yards to see an Orioles game recently, and we spent the night in a downtown hotel.  
  I was shocked to see the deplorable conditions all over town. Prostitutes, homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks, garbage in the streets, rats and open crack-smoking right in front of us. 
  I heard that it's impossible to walk the streets at night since the gangs rule the city. The grandkids couldn't wait to leave town. What a shame to see such a beautiful and historic city in such a big mess.  
  Vincent Simone,  Manhattan 
  Are the people of Baltimore better served by Rep. Cummings chasing phantom impeachment proceedings against Trump, or having him fighting for lower taxes, more jobs, health benefits, immigration reform, etc.?  
  Rolly Lessin,  Staten Island 
  The president of the United States does not attack people of color; he attacks liberal politicians who have done nothing for the people of color. 
  American sanctuary cities are suffering because of liberal policies, like being anti-charter schools, supporting a high minimum wage that's causing businesses to close and tolerating record homelessness.  
  Every major city in America has been destroyed by liberal mayors.  
  Even Bernie Sanders said Baltimore looks like a third-world country.  
  The president attacked Cummings because of his vile attack on acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAllenan, who is on the border dealing with the hell liberals have created by refusing to close the loopholes that have caused the "manufactured" crisis.  
  Trump is the first politician who has the guts to call out the racial hucksters.  
  JR Cummings,  Manhattan 
  Cummings has been criticizing the border conditions with nasty shots at Trump for a long time.  
  People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. No matter your political party affiliation, Trump is right to bring these conditions to light, as the local politicians are supposed to be helping their constituents.  
  I'm sure the residents who experience those unacceptable conditions welcome the president bringing attention to the failure of their elected politicians.  
  It appears many politicians believe they were elected to just be adversarial against the Republican Party. They don't care how much taxpayer money is wasted as long as they push their personal agenda.  
  S. L. Chute,  Manhattan 
  The current kerfuffle between truth-teller Trump and the Baltimore defenders proves once again that the more the truth is spoken, the more the pushback.

GARLIC FEST HORROR Angry young men, scourge of our nation

  Less than 24 hours after yet another mass shooting in America, the youngest fatalities a 6-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, authorities said they were still seeking a motive. 
  It seems the 19-year-old shooter gave us one. 
  "Why are you doing this?" a witness heard someone shout. 
  The response: 
  "Because I'm really angry." 
  From those mass shooters who have attacked the innocent before, we know it's a specific strain of anger - deep, repressed, biblically vengeful - felt most commonly by young men, almost always white, who report feeling alienated, dispossessed, misunderstood, victimized and all too often rejected by women. 
  Their chosen outlet is the mass slaughter of innocents, carnage at places the rest of us once deemed safe - schools, hospitals, places of work and worship, concerts, carnivals - all meant to hold us hostage, in fear of the next reprisal we're not responsible for and won't see coming. 
  Little is known yet about this shooter's history - and I refrain from using his name, since infamy is part of what these shooters seek - but so far, he fits the profile of those who've come before, the rage-induced young men we first encountered through Columbine and later Sandy Hook, Aurora, Charleston, Virginia Beach, the STEM school shooting in Colorado, Charlotte, the Poway synagogue shooting in California, the Louisiana shootings in two parishes, the Sebring shootings in Florida (those last six this year alone), the Mercy Hospital shooting, the Thousand Oaks shooting, the Tallahassee yoga studio shooting, the Jacksonville Landing shooting, the Art All Night shooting in New Jersey, the Santa Fe HS (Texas) shooting, the Nashville Waffle House shooting, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS shooting - and far too many more to mention, but all with one thing in common. 
  The ever-incubating mass shooter, these young men nurturing their anger through first-person shooter games, violent pornography, through racism and a fascination with guns and violence, is our greatest, most stubborn and pressing threat - more so, I would argue, than Islamic terrorism or Russian hacking or immigration or trade wars. 
  America is in the throes of a decades-long epidemic that we have come to regard as we do AIDS or some forms of cancer, somehow tolerating it in our body politic rather than trying to solve it, or even address it. 
  Yes, we have a president who may be our angriest ever, who unleashes daily a fusillade of threats and name-calling and sexist remarks and racist dog-whistles. But it would be facile to say Trump is the cause of this rage, which existed long before he got here, long before 9/11, long before the tech bubble or the Great Recession. 
  Wittingly or not, this collective anger is something Trump has tapped into and continues to ride, while the rest of us shout and argue over gun control or access to mental health or the culpability of parents and teachers. All of those things are relevant, of course, but they are not the cause. It is anger, stoked to malignancy by a culture in which it's become acceptable to isolate yourself and talk, online only, to people who think and blame and rage like you do. And that way of life has somehow become almost normal. 
  Last week, the nation celebrated one of humanity's greatest triumphs - the moon landing, something once commonly believed couldn't be done. Perhaps our next moon shot should, paradoxically, be more Earth-bound: a collective dedication, from the White House on down, to figuring out why young men in the world's greatest, most prosperous country are so goddamn angry.

Tackling Illegal Immigration: Beyond the DACA Dilemma

The Issue: The solution to illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States at a young age.   
  I believe, as do most Americans, that legal immigration is good ("Embarrassed Chuck is the biggest loser," Rich Lowry, PostOpinion, Jan. 23).  
  What we don't like is that we have a party that stands up for illegal immigrants more than for American citizens. 
   Illegal immigrants have no constitutional rights. They should be angry at their parents, who broke the law to bring them here in the first place. Why didn't they stay and try to make their native countries better?  
  Democrats should wake up and stand for their nation, not for votes and cheap labor. Al Marvel Scotia 
  We must find a solution to the DACA problem. The United States should create a privileged class of minors who were 12 or younger when brought here illegally.  
  Effective with the date of the legislation, they should be prohibited from leaving the country for a period of 10 years. After that, they can commence the citizenship process.  
  I believe that this solution is fair to the young people, while acknowledging that they were brought here illegally. 
  Also, chain migration and the diversity lottery must be eliminated James Landers Glen Ridge, NJ 
  Why is it only a civil violation and not a felony to illegally cross the border into the United States?  
   If Congress had raised the penalty years ago, we would not be dealing with as many Dreamers.  
  Hiring an illegal immigrant or protecting them in your city should be akin to harboring a felon. If Republicans were smart, they'd suggest this simple change to the law.  
  Is a country that doesn't protect and prioritize its legal citizens a country at all ?  
   Ronald Daba 
   Farmingville 
  There are actually about 3.6 million people who were brought to the United States illegally as children. Some 800,000 of them have qualified for DACA. 
   I don't care if it is 800,000 or 4 million or more. Even one illegal immigrant is too many. 
  Having all these illegal immigrants in our country is costing us billions of dollars each year in welfare, health, education and housing.  
  How many taxpayers think it's fair to American citizens to bear these costs? 
  Very few other countries would allow this. Why can't the United States have a border?

The Issue: Reports that Trump described African and other nations as "s -  - thole countries."  
  President Trump is right that many countries are awful places to live, wracked by bad government, poor health and low levels of educational attainment. ("Offender in chief's slur," Jan. 12). 
  But every American immigrant of Haitian or African origin who heard Trump's comments must have felt like an unwelcome second-class citizen. Most are decent and hardworking people, trying to make better lives.  
  Trump is hardly being a "president for all Americans," which is what he promised on election night. Eric Hagemann 
   Brooklyn 
  We are force-fed stories every day about people fleeing failed countries rampant with crime, corruption, famine, war and disease.  
  Yet everyone goes nuts when the president sums up those qualities in one word. Once again a leak from a closed-door meeting is being breathlessly reported as "news." 
   John Kelly 
   Edison, NJ 
  On discussing immigration, it's reported that Trump commented: "Why are we having all these people from s - - thole countries come here?"  
  Why aren't more Republicans condemning Trump's remarks in the strongest terms?  
   He's clearly unfit to hold the nation's highest office. Brenda Nicholls 
   Manhattan 
  The Never Trump crowd has a new cause for vitriol against the president.  
  All the news media broke into regular programming to claim that the president made racist remarks about immigrants. Yet President Trump never made a racist remark, explicitly.  
  The people who come here do so to escape their oppressive regimes, not because their countries are examples of equality and prosperity.  
   Ann Amadio 
   Yonkers 
  It's hard to believe that a president of the United States would use such foul language to describe other countries.  
  No president in recent memory has been as crude, unfeeling and callous toward people of other nationalities.  
  People come to this country for safety and a hope for a better life. Most of our parents and grandparents are immigrants. Trump's words are an insult to these people and to this country. He should apologize.  
  Trump needs to learn about acceptance and tolerance. Not everyone is born into wealth and opportunity. He lacks humility and compassion. 
   Diane Oriente 
   Springfield, NJ 
  What a bunch of sanctimonious hypocrites.  
  True, the president's remarks regarding certain countries were tactless and impolite, but hardly racist. Obviously he was referring to the countries, not the people who live there. 
  If you've ever visited some of these places as an ordinary traveler, you'd find his description all too accurate. You would certainly not wish to live there.  
   William Fisher 
   Suffern 
  For Trump to use that type of language is wrong. There is no defense for referring to a country with that derogatory term. Racist? I believe not, but the language is demeaning and terribly offensive.  
  With that said, CNN has used that vulgar word over and over again while reporting the comment. Repeating it on air to demean Trump is unprofessional. Ron Zajicek 
   Cortlandt Manor 
  I'm not surprised that a man as crude as Trump called several foreign nations "s - - thole countries," but it's still shocking to hear an American president blithely say such a vile thing.  
   Richard Siegelman 
   Plainview 
  The president's comment, if it's true that he made it, was certainly uncouth and unpresidential, but liberals are so fixated on race they only see Haiti and El Salvador as places with brown people.  
  Those countries have other things in common, like corruption and extreme poverty.  
  I would imagine the Haitians and El Salvadorans who risk everything to come here would be the first to agree with the president's description.

Rivals' 'race' to leapfrog Biden

  To judge by what they say and do, Democrats are obsessed with two topics: impeachment and race. With Robert Mueller's disastrous performance driving a stake through the heart of the former, race is shaping up as a defining issue in this week's second round of presidential debates.  
  As a New York Times article put it, "The searing fight over race, inequality and history has come to dominate the Democratic presidential contest." Count that as an understatement. 
  Just ask Joe Biden, who's still wondering what hit him at the first debate. But he shouldn't get lost looking back because the same club is about to whack him again.  
  Hoping to copy Sen. Kamala Harris, who scorched Biden over his opposition to school busing nearly 50 years ago and leapfrogged into the top tier of candidates, Sen. Cory Booker is preparing his own assault along racial lines. 
  Booker, polling at a measly 2 percent, is faulting Biden's criminal-justice plan and calling him the "proud architect" of a system that led to mass incarceration of minorities. And that's just for warmups. 
  "It is easy to call Donald Trump a racist now, you get no badge of courage for that," Booker said in a preview of his debate plan before the National Urban League. "The question is, what were you doing to address structural inequality and institutional racism throughout your life? Don't just tell us what you're going to do. Tell us what you've already done." 
  The logic of Booker's plan is obvious. Beyond how it lifted Harris in the polls, her attack revealed the liabilities of Biden's record and weak debating skills. He was shocked by her broadside and, ­unable to give a coherent answer, aimed to escape by looking at the clock and declaring in defeat, "My time is up."  
  To make his predicament even starker, Biden is scheduled to stand between Harris and Booker on a Detroit stage this week. 
  Biden's mental freeze in the first debate is not surprising because the 76-year-old front-runner probably assumed he was inoculated on racial issues by his faithful service as vice president to Barack Obama, America's first black president.  
  But the attacks on Biden illustrate how much Dems have changed in three years. The Obama administration was the most leftist in modern times, but those days look almost modest by comparison to this year's hysterical calls for impeaching Trump along with overt demands for socialist and race-themed policies.  
  Many candidates, congressional members and activists have become shockingly radicalized. They routinely say things and advance ideas that, not long ago, were hard to spot even on the fringe. Consider that San Francisco wants to paint over a George Washington mural! 
  As David Brooks points out in his latest Times column, the audience for this far-far-left appeal is largely white progressives. Studies show there are more of them in the party and they moved further and faster to the left than black or Hispanic Dems.  
  One result, he writes, is that they see everything from immigration to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the prism of race. 
  "White liberals have warmer attitudes toward other races than they do toward their own," Brooks ­insists.  
  The bizarre trend helps explain why attacks on "white privilege" are now required for candidates to prove their racial bona fides. An extreme example involves Beto O'Rourke, a wealthy white candidate from Texas who made his case for reparations by declaring that he and his wife are the descendants of slave owners. Even Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who used to claim he was a moderate, now says he will support a Booker bill to study how reparations for slavery could be put into practice. 
  While all this sounds like an ­exclusive appeal to minority voters, it is also just as likely to be aimed at those whites embarrassed by their race.  
  Of course, it is also a reaction to Trump, as is everything in politics these days. With apologies to Reggie Jackson, Trump is the straw that stirs the drink. 
  Where you stand on him is the key organizing principle of our time. If he is for it and you are against him, you must be against his policies even if you previously supported them. 
  Or, more accurately, you must be for the polar opposite of his policies. 
  Because he is for border control, Dems now support open borders and sanctuary cities. 
  Because his initial appeal was largely to white working-class voters who felt betrayed by both parties, and because he sometimes inflames racial matters, the left moves so sharply in the opposite direction that some of their ideas sound anti-white. 
  The increased frequency with which the "racist" tag is thrown around is one manifestation, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggesting that even Speaker Nancy Pelosi is guilty. Another is that Rep. Ilhan Omar can give an interview where she says that America should be more fearful of "white men" than Islamic terrorism - and the left defends her as being misunderstood.  
  Indeed, as I wrote last week, the Mueller hearing was the latest ­example of how hatred of Trump leads his enemies to do really stupid stuff. Fixated on showing they are morally superior, they swing so far to make their case that they seem to be on another planet. In the name of racial justice, they even want to undo economic policies that have created record-low unemployment for black and Hispanic Americans. 
  Having gone to foolish extremes with Mueller and impeachment, they are now ready to repeat the mistake with race.

  Conservative: 'Obstruction' Case Weaker Than Dems Think 
  Former special counsel Robert Mueller testifies Wednesday before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, giving Democrats "a chance to breathe life into the Mueller report," notes The Washington Examiner's Byron York. Dems on Judiciary, especially, "believe they can make an overwhelming case against Trump" on obstruction of justice, but York is doubtful. For starters, "the Mueller investigation was not actually obstructed by the president, and neither was the FBI Trump-Russia investigation that preceded it." Plus, "Mueller could never establish that the underlying crime he was assigned to investigate - conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia - actually took place." Finally, the report ­itself includes "compelling arguments against . . . obstruction allegations." Bottom line: "Without the sort of solid, incontrovertible evidence they can sell to the public, Democrats face an uphill climb, no matter how much ­attention the Mueller hearing attracts." 
  Restrictionist: The Real Horror at the Border 
  The crisis at the southern border has nothing to do with the "misleading images and scandalous, politically motivated allegations" of mistreatment at the hands of the Border Patrol, asserts Brian Lonergan at American Greatness. Instead, the gravest abuse comes from cartels who rent children to fake families, who in turn "use the children to gain entry into the United States." And yet it appears that "a criminal syndicate using children as ­immigration mules is of no great importance" to Democrats or open-borders Republicans. But their brand of "compassion" telegraphs a perverse message: "Get to the US border with a child in tow and you're good as in" - a clear recipe for the exploitation of children. 
  From the left: Trump's 2020 Achilles Heel 
  President Trump, Harry Enten contends at CNN, looks to be repeating his 2016 strategy of increasing "unfavorable ratings of his Democratic ­rival," banking on "an electoral college/popular vote split" and creating controversy with charged comments to "drive up turnout even more among groups favorable toward" him. But Enten doubts "a campaign of hardline immigration policies" will do the trick when Trump's "approval ratings remain negative," and "a lot of things can go wrong." He'll aim "to make the Democratic nominee a liberal out-of-touch candidate," but his worst behavior "risks raising turnout among nonwhite voters," which could turn big states like Texas and Arizona blue. In short, "it remains ­unclear if Trump can compensate for his unpopularity by demonizing" his opponent. 
  Foreign desk: Boris Johnson Is the Hero Britain Needs 
  "Boris Johnson really doesn't fit the commentariat's view of what a [prime minister] should be," observes Tim Montgomerie at The Telegraph, namely a career politician with a carefully manicured persona. The media "feast on his gaffes but miss what his many admirers in the country see - a long-term commitment to Brexit, to great infrastructure projects, to keeping taxes down and to home ownership." Too often, what the "elite class is interested in gets covered, and it's a fake, imbalanced account of times and challenges." But Johnson could change that if he continues "focusing on Britain's long-term potential" and eschewing conventional wisdom as he has for much of his career. 
  Culture watch: Don't Touch Bond's Sex 
  James Bond "is an incredibly well-written, specifically developed character, both in Ian Fleming's novel series and the adaptations," enthuses Paulina Enck at The Federalist. "His masculinity, and how it affects how he relates to the world and to women, is a major aspect of the persona." But now fans fear that Lashana Lynch's casting as 007 in the next film - Daniel Craig's Bond will appear but has retired the iconic call sign - is "paving the way for a lefty's dream and a Bond fan's nightmare: a female-helmed James Bond." That would be a mistake, not least for the film's bottom line: It's an attempt at "virtue-signaling to score cheap points in a #MeToo era but will ultimately fall flat under the weight of a classic character."

Prez to slow asylum wave Bilateral Guatemala deal on immigs

  President Trump announced Friday that Guatemala would agree to restrict asylum applications to the US from Central America - a win for his effort to stem the tide of illegal immigrants at the Mexican border. 
  The "safe third country" agreement would require migrants, including Salvadorans and Hondurans, who cross into Guatemala on their way to the US to apply for protections in that country instead of at the southern border.  
  It could potentially ease the crush of migrants overwhelming the immigration system and hand Trump a victory as he works to fulfill his campaign promises to curb illegal entry. 
  "This is a very big day. We have long been working with Guatemala and now we can do it the right way," he said at the White House. "This landmark agreement will put the coyotes and smugglers out of business." 
  The announcement came after a federal judge in California blocked Trump's most restrictive asylum effort to date, one that would effectively end protections at the southern border. 
  The two countries had been negotiating an agreement for months, and Trump threatened Wednesday to place tariffs on Guatemala if it didn't cut a deal. 
  The president also said the US would strike back at France's new tax targeting American tech companies - possibly by slapping tariffs on French wine, which he said wasn't as good as American wine anyway. 
  "France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron's foolishness shortly. I've always said American wine is better than French wine!" he tweeted. 
  The president, a noted teetotaller, extolled the virtues of American vintners. "I've always liked American wines better than French wines. Even though I don't drink wine. I just like the way they look," he said from the Oval Office. 
  The 3 percent tax passed in France this month will affect firms such as Facebook and Google that earn $28 million from providing digital services there.  
  Trump also said he wasn't concerned about North Korea's missile tests this week because they're just "short-range" and "my relationship is very good with Chairman Kim." 
   The president also excoriated Democrats after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jerry Nadler said they would continue investigating him. 
  "Democrats are clowns!" he declared. "We want to find out what happened with the last Democrat president. Let's look into Obama the way they have looked at me from day one. They looked into everything that we've done. They could look into the book deal that President Obama made. Let's subpoena all of his records." 
  And he defended his weekend trips to his golf club in Bedminister, NJ, insisting he was working, not on vacation. He said he preferred Bedminister to weekending at Trump Tower because he did not want to create gridlock in Midtown - and the air conditioning on the White House was on the fritz.

THEY'RE BEST OF FRENEMIES It's all good! Pelosi, AOC talk it out

  Everything is fine and dandy!  
  So says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who tweeted out a picture of her and smiling sparring partner Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to prove that, despite the two sniping back and forth, that all is well in the Democratic "family." 
  Pelosi declared they're BFFs after the duo had a tête-à-tête Friday after months of acrimony, and the veteran speaker later compared her caucus to a squabbling family that at times needs to get together to clear the air. 
  "In our caucus we have our differences. Respect that instead of making a big issue of it. Respect that. Those are our differences and how we express ourselves as representatives of our districts is our responsibility," Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol, as the House was set to adjourn for its summer recess. 
   Pelosi was so eager to convince the political world that there was peace and love in the Democratic caucus that she tweeted out a photo of the pair standing together and beaming broadly - while AOC didn't comment on the meeting. 
  "Today, Congresswoman @RepAOC and I sat down to discuss working together to meet the needs of our districts and our country, fairness in our economy and diversity in our country," Pelosi wrote. 
  Asked if she and AOC, 29, had "buried the hatchet," Pelosi, 79, replied, "I would never even say that it was a hatchet" before praising the freshman New York lawmaker. 
   "We sat down today. We had a good meeting, and the congresswoman is a very gracious member of Congress, so we had a very positive conversation about our districts and how we represent our country," she said, adding that they talked about immigration and President Trump. "I've always felt, again, [it's] just like you're in a family. In a family you have your differences. But you're still family." 
  The California Democrat noted how Republicans had produced "137,000 ads" mocking Pelosi as a "San Francisco liberal," but at the same time were trying to drive a wedge between her and the more progressive wing of her party, including AOC and three other freshmen women of color known as The Squad - Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar. 
  Pelosi and AOC have fought over issues such as impeachment and how to solve the humanitarian crisis at the southern border. 
  Ocasio-Cortez ducked reporters after attending a House Oversight Committee hearing, though chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said she told him that she had "a great meeting" with Pelosi.

letters@nypost.com A Day at Nadler's Circus: Mueller's Messy Testimony

The Issue: Robert Mueller's testimony to Congress about his report on the Russian-meddling investigation. 
  Robert Mueller's report came out several months ago and stated that there was no collusion. And it did not take a position on obstruction of justice ("Dems stung by bumble bee," Michael Goodwin, July 25).  
  The hearings with Mueller were a dog-and-pony show that again failed to give Rep. Jerry Nadler and his cronies grounds to impeach the president.  
  How many more times are the Democrats going to try and spin Mueller's report to support impeachment? It's not going to happen. 
   Phil Raschiatore,  Tampa, Fla. 
  Mueller did not bumble. In fact, during the hearing, he stated, emphatically, that Trump was not exonerated.  
  There was strong evidence of obstruction and collusion by President Trump and his accomplices. Mueller showed that Trump lied consistently in an effort to deceive the public. 
  Mueller also indicated that the Trump team was not as forthcoming as its spokespeople pretend. Donald Trump, Jr. refused to testify in person, as did his father. Numerous other members of the administration prevaricated or sidestepped direct questions. 
  Mueller noted that Russia's involvement in the 2016 election was extensive and extreme, something Trump and the Republicans have refused to acknowledge, let alone prepare to remedy. 
   Kevin Koerper,   Manhattan 
  Mueller's appearance helped clarify just how big a farce this entire investigation has been. Three years and millions of dollars later, he claims to have never heard of Fusion GPS. Really? Clearly this sham was Mueller's in name only. Shame on Nadler, Rep. Adam Schiff, et al, for pushing Mueller into this humiliating charade.  
   David Perez,   Brooklyn 
  You would think that this testimony would finally put to rest the Democrats' obsession with impeaching Trump. But no. They're going to double-, triple- and quadruple-down on their fantasy.  
   I'd say they should return to their jobs of governing, but that might not be such a good idea. Please let the adults in the room - Trump and the GOP - go about their business.  
  Louie Rey,  Summerville, SC 
  Regardless of your political affiliation, how could you not be embarrassed for Mueller?  
  His thoughts seemed muddled, and he appeared to have little memory or knowledge of his report or the facts surrounding his investigation. This is a very sad way for a man to end a long career in public service.  
  Mueller was put in a completely no-win situation and made to be a pawn in a very sick game.  
  Partisan politics is destroying everything that is decent and good in our nation. How much uglier and tawdry, destructive and divisive can these investigations and infighting become? 
   Charles Sitero,  Ormond Beach, Fla. 
  I am an American first and a Democrat second.  
  That said, I am more concerned about Russian involvement in the 2016 election than I am in prosecuting Trump for obstruction of justice.  
  More to the point, I want to know who is responsible for preventing foreign interference in the 2020 election and what resources are at their disposal now.  
  Charging Trump after he leaves office is fine by me.  
  Denny Freidenrich,  Laguna Beach, Calif. 
  When Trump is reelected in 2020 and Republicans regain full control over Congress, Democrats will rue the day they compelled Mueller to appear in their circus.  
  Their blind hatred for the president will cost them dearly.  
   Gerald Jacobs,  Manhattan 
  Forget impeachment. Accept the fact that Trump won the election, and we need to move on.  
  It's time for our elected officials to return to DC and do the job that they have neglected for the last 30 months.  
  The majority of Americans are concerned with the economy, health care, immigration and infrastructure. If these officials can't address these issues for us, replace them.  
  Andrew Zablow,  Parsippany, NJ
